<h2 align="center">CAJv4: EPICS PVData Channel Access</h2>


<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Channel access is the component of EPICS that makes process variable
data available via the network.
CAJv4 is a Java implementation of channel access which supports PVData.</p>


<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>The documentation is available via JavaDOC
 For the latest version ask for Description in <a href="doc/index.html">doc/index.html</a>
</p>

<p>CAJv4 is being developed as an eclipse project. Each release is available as a zip
file that contains the source and pre-built Java class libraries.the easiest way
to try the CAJv4 is to import the zip file into an eclipse project.</p>

<p>It is also possible to the CAJv4 without eclipse.
The unzip command creates a directory named
CAJv4 that has the following structure:</p>
<pre>CAJv4/
    bin    -  The prebuilt Java classes
    doc    -  The javaDoc. Start with doc/index.html
    src    -  The Java sources
    xml    -  Database Definition xml files for support provided by CAJv4
</pre>

<p>Add the CAJv4/bin directory to your CLASSPATH.
However you must also get the support for the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) that
is provided by eclipse. It is much easier to just make the CAJv4 an eclipse project.
</p>

<h3>Releases</h3>
<p>For now release are only available via the sourceforge CVS repository.</p>
