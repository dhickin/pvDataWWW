EPICS V4 README

This README file describes the download files available for EPICS V4.

Staus: This version of the README: 28-Nov-2011. Pertains to SNAPSHOTs of
the Java binding of EPICS V4 from this date. The C++ binding is available from
source code, which you download from epics-pvdata's Mercurial repos directly.

EPICS V4 [1] is a software toolkit for developing advanced control systems on 
top of EPICS [2], and fast service oriented architectures.

epics-pvdata is a sourceForge project for managing the development of EPICS 
version 4.

For examples of uses of the files referenced below, see the epics-pvdata exampleJava
Mercurial repo [14]. So far only includes examples of the "ChannelRPC"
functionality of EPICS V4, are included, but more will be added.


MINIMUM FILES FOR EPICS V4 RUNTIME
----------------------------------
The following files constitute the minimum runtime of the Java implementation
of EPICS V4, and its prerequisites (caj and jca). These are available from the 
epics-pvdata sourceforge download site:

pvAccess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar *    The EPICS V4 "wire protocol" [6] [7]
pvData-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar *      The EPICS V4 API for high performance data interchange [8]
pvIOC-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar *       The EPICS V4 Input/Output Processor (IOC). I.e. the server side [9] 

(*) At present we are simply building and releasing snapshots. In future, these will be version numbered.


FOR CONNECTING EPICS V4 to EPICS V3
-----------------------------------
To you will additionally need caj and jca. The pvAccess server (part of
pvAccess, above) allows an existing Channel Access client to access a javaIOC
database. The client allows the javaIOC to communicate with a Version
3 server, e.g. a javaIOC database can have links to records in a V3
IOC database. This package provides support for Channel Access Version 3. 

These are available from the epics-pvdata sourceforge download site:

caj-1.1.8.jar                  The native java Channel Access [5] library [3] 
jca-2.3.5.jar                  The API for the Java code interaction with EPICS Channel Access [4]


USEFUL EXTERNAL SOFTWARE
------------------------
These are NOT available from the epics-pvdata sourceforge download site.

1. oncrpc is an implementation of sun rpc which is required for VXI11 support. Find a JAR for it at
https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/remotetea/wiki/WikiStart [10]. Our pvIOC SNAPSHOT uses version 1.0.7.

2. For testing EPICS V4 it is very useful use the "SWTshell" GUI application [11] that helps you 
interactively configure the EPICS V4 interface. For this you need to the swt.jar. To get it, 
you can eiher install Eclipse and find swt*.jar in your eclipse install around 
.../eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.swt**.jar, or download it from http://www.eclipse.org/swt/ [12]. 
See the EPICS V4 helloWorld example service's runner script [13] for an example of including swt for
Mac OS Cocoa at runtime.
