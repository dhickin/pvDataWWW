The following files constitute the minimum runtime of the Java implementation
of EPICS V4, and its prerequisites (caj and jca):

caj-1.1.8.jar                  The native java Channel Access [5] library [3] 
jca-2.3.5.jar                  The API for the Java code interaction with EPICS Channel Access [4]
pvAccess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar *    The EPICS V4 "wire protocol" [6] [7]
pvData-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar *      The EPICS V4 API for high performance data interchange [8]
