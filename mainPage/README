This is the html doc for the source-forge epics-pvdata project.
In order to put it into the sourceforge area do the following:

scp <file> userid,epics-pvdata@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/<parent>

In order to put the javaDOC in place the old doc must be removed and the
new installed. The following uses pvData as an example:

To remove the old doc 

ssh -t USER,PROJECT@shell.sourceforge.net create

then
sf-help

LAST TIME THE FOLLOWING WORKED

cd /home/project-web/epics-pvdata
cd htdocs

then go to project and delete doc. For example
rm -fr javaIOC

then

shutdown

To put the new files in place:
1) use eclipse to generate javaDoc
2) export only doc
3) unzip the exported file
4) cd to the export top level and execute the command:
 scp -r javaIOC  <user>,epics-pvdata@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs
