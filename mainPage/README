README

This directory (pvDataWWW/mainPage/) contains the html files for 
the sourceforge epics-pvdata project. 

Installing files on the sourceforge web site
--------------------------------------------
In order to put it into the sourceforge area do the following:

    scp <file> <userid>,epics-pvdata@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/<parent-directory>


In order to put the javadoc in place the old javadoc must be removed and the
new installed. The following uses pvData as an example:

[This seems suspicious - is this really how to remove javadoc?]
--??--
To remove the old doc:
   ssh -t USER,PROJECT@shell.sourceforge.net create

then
   sf-help
??

Example:

    cd /home/project-web/epics-pvdata
    cd htdocs

  Then go to project and delete doc. For example

    rm -fr javaIOC

  Then

    shutdown

To put the new files in place:
1) use eclipse to generate javaDoc
2) export only doc
3) unzip the exported file
4) cd to the export top level and execute the command:
 scp -r javaIOC  <user>,epics-pvdata@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs

[Above scp line is inconsistent with the scp line at the top? ]
