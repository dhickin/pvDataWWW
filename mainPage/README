This is the html doc for the source-forge epics-pvdata project.
In order to put it into the sourceforge area do the following:

scp <file> userid,epics-pvdata@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/<parent>

In order to put the javaDOC in place the old doc must be removed and the
new installed. The following uses pvData as an example:

To remove the old doc the only way IO know how is to use sftp

 sftp  <user>,epics-pvdata@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs

Then


cd pvData/doc

Then visit every subdirectory and delete all files.
Then delete all subdirectories.
A real pain but I have not discovered a better way.

To put the new files in place:
1) use eclipse to generate javaDoc
2) export including javaDoc
3) unzip the exported file
4) cd to the export top level an d execute the command:
 scp -r doc <user>,epics-pvdata@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/pvData
