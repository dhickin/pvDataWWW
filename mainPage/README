-----------------------------------------------------------------

EPICS V4 [1] is a software toolkit for developing advanced control
systems on top of EPICS [2], and fast service oriented architectures.

epics-pvdata is a sourceForge project for managing the development of
EPICS version 4.

SUMMARY
-------
The latest tagged release of both C++ and Java implementations of EPICS V4 are in 
directories and tags named 2.0-BETA.

The C++ implementation of EPICS V4 is in 2.0-BETA/EPICSv4-2.0-BETA.tar.gz
The Java implementation of EPICS V4 is in 2.0-BETA/EPICSv4-Java-2.0-BETA.tar.gz
"Marchtest" for internal review only.

See the document "Getting Started with EPICS V4," 
http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/gettingStarted.html

FILES FOR EPICS V4 C++ IMPLEMENTATION 
-------------------------------------
The file EPICSv4-2.0-BETA.tar.gz includes all (and only) the C++
implementation of EPICS V4, plus a make system based on EPICS V3's
makefiles. This is available under folder 2.0-BETA/. Build instructions
and example usage are given in [16].


MINIMUM FILES FOR EPICS V4 JAVA IMPLEMENTATION 
----------------------------------------------
The file EPICSv4-Java-2.0-BETA.tar.gz includes all (and only) the Java
implementation of EPICS V4. On Unix systems, the tar file might be 
unpacked with the command:
  % tar xvfz EPICSv4-Java-2.0-BETA.tar.gz

Specifically the tar includes the following JAR files, plus the source 
for some examples (in examplesJava/) plus necessary XML files and scripts.

pvAccess-2.0-BETA.jar *    The EPICS V4 "wire protocol" [6] [7]
pvData-2.0-BETA.jar *      The EPICS V4 support for high 
                               performance data interchange [8]
pvIOC-2.0-BETA.jar *       The EPICS V4 Input/Output Processor 
                               (IOC). I.e. the server side [9] 
exampleJava/               Examples of use of EPICS V4 Remote Procedure Calling
                           (a PV that takes arguments). 

Note that, for the beta 2 distribution, pvService is not longer distributed
and is deprecated. It is not included in the beta 2 jars or tar file.

(*) The specific version number may change following modification of
this README. 

See instructions in "Getting Started with EPICS V4" [16]. This 
includes both how to build the Java distribution from sources downloaded
from the Mercurial repositories at SourceForge, and the alternative of 
downloading the tar.gz.

EXAMPLES
--------
You can find examples in the various test/ subdirectories, and in exampleJava [14]
and exampleCPP directories.

FOR CONNECTING EPICS V4 to EPICS V3 IN C++
-------------------------------------------
See pvIOC C++ implementation documentation [17], v3Channel section, for help
on connecting EPICS V3 channels to EPICS V4.
 
FOR CONNECTING EPICS V4 to EPICS V3 IN JAVA
--------------------------------------------
The pvAccess server (part of pvAccess, above) allows an existing
Channel Access client to access a javaIOC database. The client allows
the javaIOC to communicate with a Version 3 server, i.e. a javaIOC
database can have links to records in a V3 IOC database. For these
functions you will need the following files:

These are available from the epics-pvdata sourceforge download site,
or you can get them from the references provided.

caj-1.1.8.jar        The native java Channel Access [5] library [3] 
jca-2.3.5.jar        The API for the Java code interaction with 
                     EPICS Channel Access [4]


USEFUL EXTERNAL SOFTWARE
------------------------
These are NOT available from the epics-pvdata sourceforge download
site.

1. oncrpc is an implementation of sun rpc which is required for VXI11
support. Find a JAR for it at
https://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/remotetea/wiki/WikiStart [10]. Our
pvIOC SNAPSHOT uses version 1.0.7.

2. For testing EPICS V4 it is very useful use the "SWTshell" GUI
application [11] that helps you interactively configure the EPICS V4
interface. For this you need to the swt.jar. To get it, you can eiher
install Eclipse and find swt*.jar in your eclipse install around
.../eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.swt**.jar, or download it from
http://www.eclipse.org/swt/ [12].  See the EPICS V4 helloWorld example
service's runner script [13] for an example of including swt for Mac
OS Cocoa at runtime.
