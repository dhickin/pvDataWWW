      <p> In EPICS 4, a client must supply a channel provider when connecting

      <p> The client will know the list of providers which are available for it to use,
          but will not know which provider it should use for a given channel name.
          In some cases more than one provider could be used. </p>

      <!-- Second para MUST describe and shortcommings or known incompletenesses of

      <p>This is a first draft and has not received any comments/feedback
         It does not clearly state what behaviour is mandatory, what is recommended
         and what is optional. In particular, for a given implementation
         <ol>
             <li> Which methods, if any, for determining the provider must be
                  implemented? </li>
             <li> Must an implementation permit the application layer to
                  create a channel by both specifying and not specifying the
                  method to be used to determine the provider? </li>
             <li> In the reference implementation the default behaviour when no method
                  of determining the provider is suplied will be pvAccess if there has
                  been no configuration of the client or site-level configuration.
                  Should this be mandated in other implementations, or should an
                  implementer be allowed there own default? </li>
         </ol>
      </p>

      <!-- If this document is a Normative Track document, third para MUST say what
      kind of draft this version is -->
      <p> This version is an editor's draft towards the First Public Working
      Draft. The First Public Working Draft will be intended for the EPICS community
      to review and comment. Resulting comments will drive subsequent revisions of
      the Normative Types specification and the EPICS V4 Working Group's reference
      implementations of software that helps create, populate and exchange Normative
      Type PVData.  </p>

      <p> Comments are welcome, though bear in mind this is a pre-public release
      version. </p>

      <!-- Last para MUST include bibliography of terms used, eg the following -->
      <p>The terms MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT, REQUIRED, and MAY when

<h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p> EPICS 4 pvData provides structured data types <a class="bib" href="#bib:pvdata">bib:pvdata</a>.
      A client can connect to data identified by a channel name
      and once connected to perform operations which access the data (get, put, rpc, etc.).
      A channel which connects to the data is created by a channel provider.
      The pvAccess channel provider provides access for pvData using the
      pvAccess protocol <a class="bib" href="#bib:pvdata">bib:pvaccess</a>.
      The caV3 provider provides access using the EPICS base CAV3.
      Other providers are possible, e.g. TINI or TANGO.</p>

  <p> In order to connect to data identified by a channel name an channel access client must
      know which provider to use. The client knows the list of providers available to it,
      however it does not know which provider to use for a given channel name. A client may
      broadcast on multiple provider ports to establish which provider to use, however multiple
      replies may be received, with each reply implying a different provider. Specifically,
      this will happen when a channel is hosted by an V3 IOC that has both a V3 and V4 server
      on it. In this case responses may be received on both the pvAccess and V3 channel
      access ports.</p>

<h2>How to determine the provider</h2>
 
  <p> A number of methods exist for determinining which provider to use to connect to a channel.
  <ol type='a'>
     <li> Connect using a specified provider.</li>
     <li> A name resolution request [UDP broadcast] is made on multiple provider ports. More than
          one reply may be received where each implies a different provider. The client would then
          connect on the provider which answered first. Other alternatives are possible, for example
          connecting to the first reply unless a preferred provider replies within a given time.</li>
     <li> The client gets the provider from the directory service before connecting to the channel
          using the provider given.</li>
     <li> Other methods are possible, e.g. use of prefixes to determine the provider.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <p> The client application layer can:
  <ol type='1'>
     <li> Specify one of the methods above for determining the provider. In particular it may
          request connection using a specified provider.</li>
     <li> Connect to a channel without specifying the provider or the method of determing the
          provider. The choice of method is determined in the client in a layer below the
          application layer.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>
 
  </p> In case 2 the choice of method is the determined in the library functions called by
       the client application by configuration using environmental variables or other
       similar mechanism.</p>
  </p> The default configuration is pvAccess, but sites/installations can choose
        their own default behaviour or it can be set on a per client basis.</p>
