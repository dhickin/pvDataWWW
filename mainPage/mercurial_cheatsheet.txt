Installation
------------
Installing Mercurial
See http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/TutorialInstall

Download Mercurial for Mac from http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads/
Run the installer.

The mercurial command line should now be in the path (of a new 
terminal process - i.e. after install, you'll need the start a new terminal).

[pcp044184:~] greg% hg
Mercurial Distributed SCM

basic commands:

 add        add the specified files on the next commit
 annotate   show changeset information by line for each file
 clone      make a copy of an existing repository
 commit     commit the specified files or all outstanding changes
 diff       diff repository (or selected files)
 export     dump the header and diffs for one or more changesets
 forget     forget the specified files on the next commit
 init       create a new repository in the given directory
 log        show revision history of entire repository or files
 merge      merge working directory with another revision
 pull       pull changes from the specified source
 push       push changes to the specified destination
 remove     remove the specified files on the next commit
 serve      start stand-alone webserver
 status     show changed files in the working directory
 summary    summarize working directory state
 update     update working directory (or switch revisions)

use "hg help" for the full list of commands or "hg -v" for details

Man pages: After installation on a Mac, the man pages are available.
e.g.: 
$ man hg


Create your local Mercurial "repo" for your EPICS V4 work
--------------------------------------------------------- 
Having installed mercurial (hg command), create a Mercurial
"repository" for your EPICS V4 work. This is equivalent to a CVS 
development checkout area.

Ref: http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/TutorialInit

Eg:
% pwd
/Users/greg
% cd Development/epicsV4/
% mkdir repo
% cd repo
% hg init   <- this creates a .hg file


Download SOURCE EPICSv4 from epics-pvdata into your local repo
-------------------------------------------------------
Ref: http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/TutorialClone

To download the source using Mercurial, use an "hg clone".

Eg. Download the 4 core EPICS v4 modules' Java implementations:
hg clone ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvDataJava
hg clone ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvAccessJava
hg clone ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvIOCJava
hg clone ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/common

Additionally, you may need the web pages, scripts, examples, or "alpha" level software.
Eg, to download the web pages subtree (the directory system headed by pvDataWWW):

hg clone ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvDataWWW
hg clone ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvServiceJava
hg clone ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/exampleJava
hg clone ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/alpha


When completed, you should have:
[gregsmac:~/Development/epicsV4/repo] greg% ls -l
total 16
 0 drwxr-xr-x   9 greg  staff   306  7 Nov 14:41 ./
 0 drwxr-xr-x  13 greg  staff   442  4 Nov 17:11 ../
 0 drwxr-xr-x  19 greg  staff   646  7 Nov 14:39 pvAccessJava/
 0 drwxr-xr-x  12 greg  staff   408  7 Nov 14:37 pvDataJava/
 0 drwxr-xr-x   6 greg  staff   204  3 Nov 17:20 pvDataWWW/
 0 drwxr-xr-x  24 greg  staff   816  7 Nov 14:40 pvIOCJava/
 0 drwxr-xr-x  16 greg  staff   544  7 Nov 14:41 pvServiceJava/


NOTE: The hg http URIs don't work for many users, since the non-standard 8000 port is blocked
for HTTP by many institutions. Use the ssh one above.


Add Files to your local repository 
----------------------------------
Analogous to cvs add.

Use hg add <filename>
E.g.:
% hg add charter_14092011.html
[pcp044184:repo/pvDataWWW/mainPage] greg% hg add charter_15092011.html

Get status of your local repository
-----------------------------------
Analogous to cvs status

Use hg st
E.g.:
% hg st
M mainPage/charter.html
A mainPage/charter_14092011.html
A mainPage/charter_15092011.html


Put your changes back into epics-pvdata in sourceforge
------------------------------------------------------
This is different in idea to the way CVS does it; in particular the
commit command of hg is different to the commit command of 
CVS. In hg, commit makes the *local* repository "database" updated with changes
you made to files. Only after you have committed to your own repository,
can you update the remote repository. You do the remote update
with the hg "push" command. 

So, assuming you've changed some files and/or added some,
putting them in epics-pvdata at sourceforge is now a 3 stage process:

0. hg update

    If you don't hg update first, and someone has changed remote repo files, then your
    push will run into difficulties requiring a merge, even if no files are in common
    between what you changed and what they changed. So, always a good idea.
 
1. hg commit -u gregorywhite@slac.stanford.edu

    ** You'll be dropped into an editor - vi by default, so if you don't know the vi voodoo, beware **
   Hint - hit "i" to enter insert mode, to actually type something
     - hit "ESC : w q" to write and quit.
   To make this easier:
   i) Create a ~/.hgrc file with a username entry, like:
       [gregsmac:repo/pvDataWWW/mainPage] greg% cat ~/.hgrc
       # This is a Mercurial configuration file.
       [ui]
       username = Gregory White <greg@slac.stanford.edu>
   ii) use -m to put the commit message on the command line. Eg
       hg commit -m "add talks"

2. hg push

   Output should look something like:
   pushing to ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvDataWWW
   searching for changes
   remote: adding changesets
   remote: adding manifests
   remote: adding file changes
   remote: added 1 changesets with 5 changes to 5 files
   remote: Running changegroup hook


Add files and directories
=========================
Done with hg add

To add a directory with files in it, just add the directory. Directories and files beneath will be added:
E.g.:
% hg add talks
adding talks/.DS_Store
adding talks/2010/gabriele_PVManager.pptx
adding talks/2011/.DS_Store
adding talks/2011/bob_V4EPICS201109.pptx
adding talks/2011/marty_pvDataEtc.ppt

Update your repo with changes made in source-forge:
===================================================
1. Pull changes made in SF down to your repo, done with hg pull.
%  hg pull ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvDataWWW

2. Then, to give yourself access to these changes, run hg update 
% hg update

Mercurial Configuration (.hgrc in your home directory)
======================================================

Add a new diff tool:

[extensions]
extdiff=

[extdiff]
# add new command called kdiff, runs kdiff3 
cmd.kdiff = kdiff3

When you do a "hg pull" it will show all the files that will be changed when you do an "hg update":

[hooks]
changegroup=hg diff --stat -r $HG_NODE -r tip

Add a new alias to commit everything except configure/RELEASE and configure/CONFIG_SITE 
(not recommended, use RELEASE.local instead):

[alias]
cmt = commit -X configure/RELEASE -X configure/CONFIG_SITE
