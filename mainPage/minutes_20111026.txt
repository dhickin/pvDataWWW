Minutes of EPICS V4 Working Group 26.10.2011
Scribe: Timo

-NTTable and other normative types need a clear definition (Greg)

-channelRPC: accept the inefficiency and make it symmetric

-NTTable as "corba any" is too flexible. Allow any for both arguments and result instead of just the result.

-drop channelGetOnce, channelPutOnce and channelPutGetOnce

-callbacks in channelGet: to recover from timeout, it is necessary to re-create the channelGet? Yes. Cancel is lacking. Talk to 
Matej. However, probably ok as it is.

-what happens if a new request is issued before getDone was called for the previous get? (Matej)

-comparison of pvAccess and simple tcp communication. pvAccess gets to about 80% of raw tcp, however, depends a lot on 
several options.

-to pack data into structures, packers need to be written by hand (corba: dd compiler)

-Rename SyncPVA instead of EZPVA. Removes the callback interfaces

-For non-normative types, the callback interface has to be used.

-comments to action items should be added

-specifically for this discussion to "start proposal for simplifying the programmers API"

-Marty at Brookhaven next week tue,wed,thu (1.-3..11)

-NTTable definition a high priority

-a snapshot-restore service needed in 2 months (Guobao), NTTable required for that.
