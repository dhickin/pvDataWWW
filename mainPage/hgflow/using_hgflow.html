<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Since modern distributed revision control systems have gained popularity
within software developers, many branching and workflow models have been
developed, which differ in features and grade of adoption.</p>

<p>A particular model that has gained wide-spread popularity is the workflow
developed and described 2010 by Vincent Driessen, originally for the Git
version control system, referred to as the <a
href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"
target="_blank">Driessen branching model</a>.</p>

<p>For the Mercurial community, Yujie Wu develops and supports a Mercurial
plugin called <a href="https://bitbucket.org/yujiewu/hgflow" target="_blank">hg
flow</a> that implements a generalized version of the Driessen model. It offers
convenient high-level commands for operations on branches, avoiding the complex
and mechanical low-level operations needed to achieve the required
operations.</p>

<p>This document uses the original illustrations by Vincent Driessen.</p>

<h3>Why Branched Development?</h3>

<p>For larger projects with many developers, a model based on one development
line in a central repository is not working well. Processes like large feature
developments (with multiple developers involved) and the preparation of a new
release (going through phases of pre-releases and release candidates) can take
weeks and would block the development of other features or important bugfixes.
Support of older versions is hard. Tracking bugfixes across releases is
tedious.</p>

<h3>Features of the Generalized Driessen Model</h3>

<p>Vincent Driessen published a branched development model for Git in a <a
href="http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/"
target="_blank">blog article</a> in January 2010. His original model was later
extended with the addition of <em>support branches</em> allowing long-term
support of older releases. The <em>stream</em> generalization allows to group
branches in a directory-like fashion.</p>

<p>When mapping this Git-based model to existing Mercurial repositories with a
history, is seems appropriate to use the default branch (with the development
history) as develop, and create a new branch called master for generating the
releases.</p>

<div>
<p><a href="http://nvie.com/files/Git-branching-model.pdf"><img
alt="Driessen Branching Model" src="model.png" style="float: right" width="611"
height="815" /></a> </p>

<p>There are two main trunks with an infinite lifetime (i.e., created at
initialization and never closed):</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <em><strong>develop</strong> </em>trunk<em></em> carries the main
    line of development. All changes, features, and fixes are eventually merged
    into <code>develop</code>. Small developments needing only one or two
    commits can happen directly on <code>develop</code> trunk, larger features
    or features for a future release (i.e., not the next release) should be
    developed in feature branches.</li>
  <li>The <em><strong>master</strong> </em>trunk<em></em> carries the main line
    of releases. Every commit (usually a merge commit) on <code>master</code>
    is a release, and should be tagged accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are four additional streams (groups of branches), which carry a
varying number of branches (i.e., branches are created and closed as part of
the workflow):</p>
<ul>
  <li>A <em><strong>support</strong></em> stream branch is created off a
    specific release (i.e., a specific commit on <code>master</code>), and
    carries bugfix releases for that parent release. It is similar to the
    master trunk: every commit is a release, and it is never closed.</li>
  <li>The <em><strong>feature</strong> </em>stream branches carry development
    of features that are either complex and/or intended for a later release.
    They are created off <code>develop</code> (either off develop trunk or off
    a develop branch), and are merged back into their parent.</li>
  <li>A <em><strong>release</strong> </em>stream branch is created off
    <code>develop</code> (trunk or branch) when the releasing process starts.
    It collects all changes necessary for that particular release (bugfixes,
    tags), but no feature developments. When the release process is done, the
    release branch gets merged into <code>master</code> (creating the release),
    and into its parent (feeding back the changes into the development
  stream).</li>
  <li>A <em><strong>hotfix</strong> </em>stream branch is similar to a release
    branch, but created off <code>master</code> (or a support branch). It
    collects all changes necessary for fixing a bug and for a possibly
    shortened release process. When the fix is tested and can be released, the
    hotfix branch gets merged into its parent (creating the release), and often
    into <code>develop</code> trunk (feeding back the changes into the
    development stream).</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>Sub-streams of <code>develop</code> and <code>feature</code> can be created
in a directory-like hierarchy, to collect branches that belong together. E.g.,
the developments during a certain code sprint or codeathon could go into a
develop sub-stream, or different parts of a complex feature could be developed
in a feature sub-stream.</p>

<p>The following table lists the different types of branches in the Driessen
model, with their most important properties.</p>

<p>Within the context of hg flow, the term <em>stream</em> is used for either a
set of related branches, either at the top level or at the branch level, or for
an individual branch. Some hg flow operations can be applied as well to an
individual branch as to a stream, i.e. to all individual branches that belong
to that stream.</p>

<p>Features of this branched development model that might or might not be
present in other models:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The streams separate commits and tags by functionality, making the
    history (commit log) of each stream much clearer: 
    <p>The develop and feature streams only contain development commits (and
    merges). The release stream only contains commits and tags from the
    releasing process. The master stream only contains public releases. The
    hotfix stream only contains bugfix commits.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The releasing process is done on a branch and does not hold up
    development in any way.</li>
  <li>As each commit on <code>master</code> is a public release, it is easy to
    connect CI publishing jobs to it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Simplified Branching Model for EPICS V4 Development</h2>

<p>The full Driessen model seems too complicated for use in V4 development.
Only a small subset of the described features and streams is needed to support
the current workflow. If streams and features are considered useful at a later
time, they can be added as needed.</p>

<p>EPICS development does not follow the idea of one strict release branch that
all releases can be created from. Usually, any EPICS release has long-time
support and receives bugfixes as well as bugfix releases, each of which may or
may not undergo a releasing procedure with multiple tagged pre-release
versions.</p>

<p>To support this approach, the functionalities of release, master, hotfix,
and support branches are combined in the release branches, which are not
closed/merged, but left open to receive bugfixes and provide bugfix
releases.</p>

<p>This maps nicely onto the current workflow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Development is done on the <code>develop</code> trunk or on feature
    branches (for larger developments), that are merged back into the
    <code>develop</code> trunk.</li>
  <li>When a new release (e.g. 4.4) is to be created, a release branch is
    created from the <code>develop</code> trunk (release/4.4). The release
    process (tagging, bug fixing, pre-releasing, release candidates) and the
    final release (4.4.0) are done on this branch. This branch stays open, and
    further bugfix releases (4.4.1, 4.4.2, ...) are done as needed.</li>
  <li>Bug fixes can be merged back any time from release branches into
    <code>develop</code> trunk as appropriate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Advantages:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The release process does not block the <code>develop</code> trunk at all,
    so that development can immediately continue.</li>
  <li>Release tagging is done on the release branches and does not clutter up
    the <code>develop</code> trunk.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Usage Examples</h2>

<p>After explaining the <a href="#installation">installation and setup</a> of
the hg flow plugin for Mercurial, the <a href="#basic_procedures">Basic
Procedures</a> section covers the initial workflow operations. These include
the mandatory <code>develop</code> trunk, developing on feature branches, and
releasing on <code>release</code> branches.</p>

<p>The <a href="#advanced_features">Advanced Features</a> section describes
operations on that can be introduced as needed. <em style="color:#ff0000">This
section is not complete.</em></p>

<h2>Sample Script</h2>

<p>You can execute the <a href="hgflow-sample">sample script</a>, which will
create a repository in a subdirectory called sample, and run all described
operations using a small set of text files. </p>

<h2>Installation and Configuration of hg flow<a name="installation"
id="installation"></a></h2>

<p>Use of the hg flow plugin is not mandatory.</p>

<p>Install hg flow (&gt;= 0.9.6) according to the <a
href="https://bitbucket.org/yujiewu/hgflow/wiki/Home.wiki#!installation"
target="_blank">installation instructions</a>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Download the latest release from the <a
    href="https://bitbucket.org/yujiewu/hgflow/downloads"
    target="_blank">download page</a>.</li>
  <li>Unpack hgflow.py into an arbitrary directory, e.g.,
  <code>~/.hgext</code>.</li>
  <li>Edit the hg configuration file <code>~/.hgrc</code> (or
    <code>%USERPROFILE%/Mercurial.ini</code> on Windows), adding a line to the
    <code>[extensions]</code> section: 
    <pre>[extensions]
flow = /PATH/TO/hgflow.py</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Make sure to enable the <a
    href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension" target="_blank">mq</a>
    and <a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/RebaseExtension"
    target="_blank">rebase</a> extensions (in the same place): 
    <pre>[extensions]
mq =
rebase =</pre>
  </li>
  <li>Enable autoshelve (not mandatory). This will automatically shelve and
    unshelve uncommitted changes when switching between branches. Add the
    following to the hg configuration file: 
    <pre>[flow]
autoshelve = true</pre>
    This feature needs the <a
    href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/MqExtension" target="_blank">mq
    extension</a>.</li>
  <li>Set the version prefix (used for release tag names) to the empty string.
    Add the following to the hg configuration file: 
    <pre>[flow]
version_prefix = ''</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic Procedures</h2>

<p>The tables containing the command examples always show the basic hg commands
(without using the hg flow plugin) in the left column, while the hg flow
commands are shown in the right column. </p>

<h3>Be Safe</h3>

<p>Branched development is no picnic. Be aware of structures and procedures.</p>

<p>Back up your repository (local copy using <code>cp -a</code>) before complex
operations.</p>

<p>Every hg flow command takes <code>--dry-run</code> as an option to print out
what the command would do, without changing the repository. Check if it will do
what you intend to do.</p>

<p>Use the built-in help function: <code>hg flow help</code> will get you
started.</p>

<h3>Initialize hg flow for an Existing Repository</h3>

<p>The EPICS V4 repositories will have an existing development history in the
<code>default</code> branch when being initialized for use with hg flow. This
needs a small change to the default setup, as we will use the
'<code>default</code>' branch for the develop trunk, and create a new branch
'<code>master</code>' for the master trunk.</p>

<p>In the top level of your repository, run the <code>hg flow init</code>
command:</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%">
  <col width="50%" />
  <col width="50%" />
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg init</strong></pre>
      </td>
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg init</strong></pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td></td>
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg flow init</strong>

(branches are permanent and global, did you want a bookmark?)
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Navigate Between Branches</h3>

<p>You can switch to any branch or trunk using the <code>hg flow
&lt;stream&gt;</code> command:</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%">
  <col width="50%" />
  <col width="50%" />
  <tbody>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg update default</strong>
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</pre>
      </td>
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg flow develop</strong>
flow: Update workspace to &lt;develop&gt; trunk.
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
flow: &lt;develop&gt; trunk: default
flow: Open &lt;develop&gt; branches:
flow:   default*</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg update feature/addFile3</strong>
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</pre>
      </td>
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg flow feature addFile3</strong>
flow: Update workspace to &lt;feature&gt; 'addFile3'.
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h3>Simple Development on Develop Trunk</h3>

<p>Switch to the <code>develop</code> trunk:</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%">
  <col width="50%" />
  <col width="50%" />
  <tbody>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg update default</strong>
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</pre>
      </td>
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg flow develop</strong>
flow: Update workspace to &lt;develop&gt; trunk.
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
flow: &lt;develop&gt; trunk: default
flow: Open &lt;develop&gt; branches:
flow:   default*</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Edit and commit as usual.</p>

<h3>Development on a Feature Branch</h3>

<p>Create a feature branch off <code>develop</code> trunk:</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%">
  <col width="50%" />
  <col width="50%" />
  <tbody>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg update default</strong>
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
&gt; <strong>hg branch feature/addFile3</strong>
marked working directory as branch feature/addFile3
&gt; <strong>hg commit --message "Create branch 'feature/addFile3'."</strong></pre>
      </td>
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg flow feature start addFile3</strong>
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
marked working directory as branch feature/addFile3</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><img alt="Feature Branch" src="fb.png" align="right" hspace="20" width="133"
height="352" /></p>

<p>Edit and commit as usual.</p>

<p>When feature development is complete, finish the branch (first you might
have to navigate to the branch you want to finish):</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%">
  <col width="50%" />
  <col width="50%" />
  <tbody>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg update feature/addFile3</strong>

flow: You are already in &lt;feature&gt; 'addFile3'.</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr valign="top">
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg commit --message "Close &lt;feature&gt; 'addFile3'." --close-branch</strong>
&gt; <strong>hg update default</strong>
0 files updated, 0 files merged, 1 files removed, 0 files unresolved
&gt; <strong>hg merge feature/addFile3</strong>
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
&gt; <strong>hg commit --message "Merge &lt;feature&gt; 'addFile3' to &lt;develop&gt; ('default')."</strong></pre>
      </td>
      <td><pre>&gt; <strong>hg flow feature finish</strong>
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved
1 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved</pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The feature branch is closed, and merged back into the <code>develop</code>
trunk.</p>

<h3>Release Process</h3>

<p>Create the release branch off <code>develop</code> trunk:</p>

<table border="0" style="width: 100%">
  <col width="50%" />
  <col width="50%" />
  <tbody>
    <tr valign="top">

</table>

<p>Change, commit and tag preparing for the release on the newly created
release branch. This includes all changes necessary for pre-release and
release-candidate stages, up to preparing the final release. At any point,

<p>The release branch is never closed, and works as a bugfix and support branch
for this release. I.e., in this example it will carry the releases 1.0.0,
1.0.1, 1.0.2, ...</p>

<h2>Advanced Features</h2>

<h3>Autoshelve</h3>

<p>Developing using a branched model often leads to situations where you want
to switch to a different branch while having uncommitted changes in your
working directory that you want top keep with the original branch.</p>

<p>The <code>autoshelve</code> feature (see <a
href="#installation">Installation</a> section) uses Mercurial's mq extension to
automatically shelve your uncommitted changes when you leave a branch, and
unshelve them when you return. It tracks your uncommitted changes for each open
branch.</p>

<h3>Start Branch from Dirty Workspace</h3>

<p>The <code>--dirty</code> option allows to carry uncommited changes in the
workspace onto a newly created branch.</p>

<p>Assume you have started to work on a feature on develop trunk, and at some
point you realize you rather want to develop it in a feature branch. Using this
option you can create a feature branch and move your changes onto the new
branch in one step:</p>
