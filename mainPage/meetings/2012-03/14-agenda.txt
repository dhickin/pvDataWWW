Colleagues, 

*Note meeting time in your timezone [0]*. US is now in observance of Summer Time; but Europe
isn't. We'll go with the Americans as usual because they're big and cumbersome and 
everyone always has to work around them. So, we'll switch to Summer Time - 
which puts it an hour earlier than usual for Europeans. Same next week.  

Please find below the agenda for our weekly EPICS V4 telecon [1]. Minutes
in titanpad [2].
