/><br
/>************<br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: Normative Types</b><br
/>************<br
/>MK: concerns about ntfield_t (section 3).&nbsp;<br
/>MK: suggests to extend ntfield_t with structure_t and structure_t[]<br
/>MK and GW: discussion about structure_t[] in the context of Maser<br
/>GW: thinks that Maser uses application-specific types but normative<br
/>types should be general.<br
/>GS, MK, GW: discussion about scope of normative types<br
/>GW: NTTable is not CORBA any<br
/>MK &amp; GS: Maser should rely on only normative types<br
/>GW &amp; JR: consider that normative types represent only subset&nbsp;<br
/>(90%) of (many) application types, for example, archiver<br
/>GS: suggests two extensions of normative types, NTTable and NTNameValue (performance reason)<br
/>GW: good idea. If they are generic enough, then we can add<br
/>them as normative types.<br
/>JR &amp; DH: also consider (probably, non-normative) new type(s)&nbsp;<br
/>for archiver<br
/>MK: does not like "NTMatrix" and suggests like "NTNDArray"<br
/>JR: NTNDArray is reserved by AreaDetector<br
/>AJ: agrees with Marty, probably NT2DArray ...<br
/>GW: plans to think about comments ...<br
/><br
/>************<br
/><b>AI</b> on GS &amp; MK by Mar-22-12: Write proposal to intoduce a new normative type for addressing&nbsp;<br
/>requirements of Maser and (probably) Archiver. Specifically for representation and transport of numbers of channels, where each channel may be a waveform valued channel.<br
/>************<br
/>GW: suggests to consider and extend NTMultichannelArray<br
/><br
/>************<br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: </b><u>Normative Types self identification review of Andrew's suggestion</u><br
/>************<br
/><br
/>AJ: suggest to apply the aspect-oriented approach<br
/>AJ: The bitfield that defined the contents of the type may be extendible for&nbsp;<br
/>data that are extensions of NTypes.<br
/>NM: What is teh definition of trait?<br
/>GW: let's consider NTAggregate (section 6.6) What is relationship<br
/>between types and traits?<br
/>AJ: bitfield can be associated with a structure rather than a structure member<br
/><br
/>All: hot discussion about type ids .... no convergence<br
/><br
/>GW (with the help of AJ) will try to implement some&nbsp;<br
/>demo to resolve issues.<br
/><br
/><br
/>************<br
/><b>NEW TOPIC:</b><u> Version release requirement (do we need a beta 1.1 or beta 1.0.1, or not?)</u><br
/>************<br
/><br
/>GS: needs a version number for his debian package<br
/><br
/>GW: Suggets libpvdata--20120315<br
/><br
/>AI on JR by (open): Release new snapshot for c++ called beta-1.0.1<br
