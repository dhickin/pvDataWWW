Colleagues, 

Please find below the agenda for our weekly EPICS V4 telecon [1]. Timo, Ralph and I had a 
test of the etherpad system. We decided to try that out NEXT week, when Ralph will be back 
with us. For now, just Skype.

We haven't got an updated version of the pvAccess protocol spec following comments made so
far. I suggest we don't revisit that until next week. 
 
Agenda
======

0. Preliminaries

1. Architectures document comments (30 minutes)

   *All* please check out the architectures document [2] as it is so far. We'll review comments
   made in email or verbally in the meeting, so *James* gets some feedback.
 
2. MASER status update (*Guobao* 15 minutes)

3. Performance measurement planning (20 minutes)

   *Matej* - how does Japex look.
   Shall we implement a japex measurement system?
      - Measure against a jca/caj driver?
      - What data to measure?
      - Who will lead this? 
      - When?
      - How sophisticated? - part of Jenkins?
   Shall we use Japex for CPP measurement?
      - Vs ca?

   *Bob* made a suggestion that we should measure our implementation of 
   pvAccess against ASN.1 BER and or PER encodings of a test suite,
   by asking for volunteers on tech-talk.
