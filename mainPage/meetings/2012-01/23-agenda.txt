Colleagues,

Guobao has reserved training room 1 for our meeting from 23 ~ 26. I'm pretty
sure that's basically at [6] but I think we've all been there before.
Has projector and wireless. Thanks Guobao.

See you there!
Greg

Slightly Revised Agenda
=======================

MONDAY (9.00 am, room to be announced)
======================================
Morning Morning
* Preliminaries, finding that our room is occupied, wireless connection, intro to Titanpad, coffee. (30 mins)
* Reports and developed systems 
   + 9.30 Report from Lingyun Yang, BNL physicist who has used the python interface. Lingyun Yang
   + rdbService (*Greg*)
   + archive service (*James*)
   + MASER (*Guobao*, *Marty*)
   + bpm simulator (*Timo*)

Break 

 * Gather service (*Marty*).
   + Include present status, architecture, and examples.
     Outcomes: In particular I'd like to see how it would be used in the context 
     of 2 or more co-existing services such as a bpm orbit service (acquiring from many BPMs on the same 
     timing signal) and a magnet service (which must set many magnet field values at the same time)
     and where these 2 both use the gather service support at the same time. 

Lunch

Monday Afternoon

* Normative Types Review [2] (*Greg*)
  + Look at definitions for NTStatistic, NTHistogram (*Nikolay*) and 
    NTChannelFinderDirectory (*Ralph*)
  + NTImage definition and areaDetector presentation (*James*)
  + Confirm definitions of NTArray, NTImage, NTTable.
  + Outcomes: How shall an Ntype self identify as such.

* Unsigned handling proposal and examples (*Marty*)

Break

* EZPVA review [3] (if Normative types overflows, this will be on Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday)

  (*Marty* and *Matej*, when we last looked at this you guys wanted to "go away and
  think about it" and report back.  


TUESDAY (9.00 am room to be announced)
======================================
Tuesday Morning

* pvAccess spec (suspect 2nd PWD will be ready about the meeting time. Review)
  + Invited reviewer comments.
    Andrew. If we have comments from Jeff and and Phillip Duvall that would be great too. 
  + Confirm plans for implementation of multicast

 Lunch   

Tuesday afternoon

 * Architectures. *James* lead.
   + Nominal architectures and architectures doc [4]
   + Diagram the basic architectures people might use.
   + ChannelFinder integration. 
     . Status and delivery estimate of ChannelFinder ev4 service. 
   + What can be done further to smooth backward integration of EPICS V4 with V3? Anything?
   Outcome: I'd like us to have identified and diagrammed the basic architectures
   which implement; interoperability with CA and V3 IOCs, Services, SOA with DS based on 
   ChannelFinder, Gather based services, pvManager/CSS. 


WEDNESDAY (9.00 am, room to be announced)
==========================================

Next Steps

 * Plans for a command line tool. I'd like to see a reference client 
   side API, that can be used commonly by GUI/display manager implementers, 
   GUIs apps, and command line tool implementers. 
   Outcome: Who will create a command line tool. Which types will it know (eg NTTable).
            Will it include argument passing. Will it do monitor?

 * pvManager integration status (*Gabriele*).
 * Directory Service through pvAccess, status (*Ralph*).

Wednesday Afternoon

 * BNL/FRIB Database services. Telcon with FRIB

 * BETA 1 and pvAccess announcements! By meeting will be 1 month behind 
   waiting on pvAccess edits and comments.
   Do we need a BETA 1.1? I have things I'd like to add. 
 * BETA 2 readiness review
   http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/charter.html#milestones

 * Deliverables review.
   http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/charter.html#deliverables
   + Seems we should drop deliverable 14, A Programmers Guide for EPICS V4 protocol 
   implementers (for developing implementations of pvAccess, pvData or pvIOC)
   + Deliverable 10, A report of interoperability of the EPICS V4 IOC with EPICS v3 record 
     processing. Time to start this. Matej, is the pvIOCCPP V3 interop ready [5].

 * Beer, cigarettes, and low speed chase across Long Island with a call girl named Pinky.
