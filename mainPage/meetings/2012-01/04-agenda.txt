Hi everyone, Happy New Year,

Please find below the agenda for our weekly telecon. 

Bob is skiing - for which he will never be forgiven. So, we may have a little issue
starting the call since we won't have the "EPICS V4" skype group up. I'll call everyone in manually. 
Apologies for late sending, I was travelling today.

Cheers
Greg

  2. Status review, 30 mins.

    We're 4 months in to a charter for 12 months. Let's review what everyone is 
    now doing, and check that the March beta 2 plan [2] is realistic and we can start on it.

    Specific commitments:
    *Greg* - interoperable types
    *Guobao* - Performance report
    *Marty* Gather service framework
    *Matej* and *Marty* "ezpva"
