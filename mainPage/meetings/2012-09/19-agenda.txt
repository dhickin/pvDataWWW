Colleagues,

Let's have a short status meeting tomorrow at the usual time.

Agenda
------
Status with respect to a candidate release

Also, there is a new NTypes spec [1], that includes a new method of self-identification
and a revised NTTable (intended to integrate Ben and Ralph's comments). However, I haven't
myself had time to check it against their emails and to proof read. Still, you can yell
at me about it if you like. It's intended to get us going with a basic system which will work 
for beta 2 demos.

Cheers
Greg
