<body><b>Present:</b> BD, GS, MS, MK, GW, JR<br
/><b>Scribe:</b> GW<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: Use of SWT in pvIOC distribution.</b><br
/><br
/><b>RESOLUTION</b>: We will move the pvioc.swtshell package to its own EPICS V4 project [that is, a new independent repo].<br
/><br
/>Marty and Matej will do that either before or after the BNL Oct Meeting, depending on their own progress at meeting<br
/>the demo objectives from the September 5 telecon (<a href="http://epicsv4.titanpad.com/ep/pad/view/27/latest)">http://epicsv4.titanpad.com/ep/pad/view/27/latest)</a> .<br
/><br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: policy for choice of wire provider (v3Channel or CAV3) when both are possible.</b><br
/><br
/><b>AI: Matej</b> will develop a policy that implements the mechanism to choose. One policy choice will be that<br
/>both providers will be given a chance to respond and a preferred provider will be used if it responds.<br
/><br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: Status of VxWorks port</b><br
/><br
/><b>AI: Matej</b>, check with Dirk.<br
/><br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: ServiceClient, ServiceClientFactory and ServiceClientRequester&nbsp;</b><br
/><br
/><b>RESOLUTION</b>: ServiceClient, ServiceClientFactory and ServiceClientRequester&nbsp; will be moved to pvaccess from pvService.<br
/><br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: BD asks Question: Is there consensus on Self-ID and why we need it?&nbsp;</b><br
/><br
/>MS: Self ID isn't needed for pvAccess itself<br
/>BD: Is it necessary for memory allocation at an endpoint? Presumably not.<br
/>Correct.<br
/>GW: Self-ID is to help a client determine how to interpret the data in a (pvData) structure. The reason we had so much discussion about it was that it was being proposed that EPICS V4 should define a type system, and that type system should be polymorphic. Example: we define NTTable. Some institution decides to extend NTTable to produce "BPMOrbitTable" by adding some requried fields. A client that knows NTTable, but doesn't speocically know BPMOrbitTable, should be able to display those facets of BPMOrbitTable object that conform to NTTable. However, we have decided as a group that to support this, possibly multiple inheritance, system all from inside code, is too hard for this charter.<br
