Gregory White:=========== Meeting 19-Oct-2011 ============
 
Present: GW, JR, MK, MS, GS
Scribe: James

 GW: prepared list of outcomes of EPICS and ICALEPCS in the agenda for this meeting
 GW: first discussion point is MK priorities
 GW: top are normative types and making client side interface easy to code
 GW: client side interface (not gather) is hard to code for
 GW: need base code that can be expanded on by the user
 JR: pvget and pvput in c++ are good examples, formalize these so they can be extended
 GW: accommodate programmer who wants ezca an ca equivalents
 MK: may want to start many things and wait for completion
 MK: or may want pvget where it waits for everything to be done
 GW: must accommodate both
 MK: what about simplified get, put etc. 2 levels, 1) make request and wait for request to be done
 MK: 2) combined model turning callbacks into blocking with timeout
 JR: blocking vectorized get and put is 90% of matlab and python usage at diamond
 MK: gather service provides this
 GW: interface should wrap use of gather or not
 MK: propose coming up with straw-man interface for the end of the week to help clarify this issue, get and monitor first
 MK: have agreed on alarms and timestamps two weeks ago, implementing now
 MK: also working on alarm limits to be done end of this wekk
 GW: action on MK for normative type alarm what is progress? 
 MK: need input for NT documentation
 GW: need input from Bob to NT documentation, will circulate
 MK: normative types will have a numeric type identifier
 Gregory White: *AI on MK by 20-Oct*: Publish first editors draft of simplified programmer interface for pvAccess/pvData
 Gregory White:pvData API
 GW: normative type integer id specifies a restricted set of pvData introspection types
 GW: pvService module is for service framework not services
 *AI on GW (27 Oct)* publish an editors draft of normative types.
 MK: javadoc in frames is in the eclipse project, but not on the web site
 GW: want web links to overviews, javadoc and overviews as single page
 MK: how to keep in sync?
 GW: javadoc needs to be generated by maven or checked in to hg
 Matej (passive):JavaDoc is 99% already integrated. Just  ine check-box to be enabled, etc.
 Matej (passive):Actually javadoc is already generated.
 Gregory White:Matej, wher is it delivered to?
 Matej (passive):https://irmis-dev.bnl.gov/jenkins/view/Epics%204/job/pvDataJava%20-%20Build/
 Matej (passive):Gabriele can eas
 Matej (passive):WWW can be easily generated. e.g. http://epics-jca.sourceforge.net/caj/apidocs/index.html
 Matej (passive):Gabrielle can do this is a couple of seconds :)
 *AI on Gabriele*, create javadoc from pvData,Access,IOC,Service from hg and publish to web
 GW: need single document for each project joining each overview page
 JR: need script to make documentation
 MS: use word to generate PDF or HTML
 GW: may be possible to use javadoc to concatencate pages
 *AI on GW Oct 31* work out how to create single file javadoc of overviews
 MK: C++ has single docuements for each project
 *AI on MK* to write proposal for unsigned handling including example
 JR: confirmed that pvData wire format will have the signed/unsigned bit
 Gregory White: *AI on MK by 26th Oct*: to write proposal for unsigned handling including example
 *AI on MK by 21st Oct*: to write document for get, put and vectorized get and put
 MK: to visit BNL next week to work on gather with Guobao
 GW: TK tested fake BPM data from v3 IOC through pvAccess 
 GW: from a number of BPMs, could form test for v3 gather
 *AI on JR by 2nd Nov*: Prototype architecture document for discussion
 GW: anon clone not working for some people
 guobao:should be proxy problem
 MK: works ok at home
 JR:  works at diamond
 MK: not working at ICALEPCS
 GW: should put notice on site about ports
 GW: should release zips and jars
 Matej (passive):We already have JARs.
 MK: need to discuss releases
 MK: need to know how to operate maven from Gabriele
 Matej (passive):For C++ I strongly recommend building. No binaries. As for EPICS base.
 MS: just no compiled binaries
 GW: agreed for C++ just distribute tar file of sources like epics base
 GS: MD is building debian packages for V3
 guobao:but I can not say
 Matej (passive):No.
 Matej (passive):Debian packages contain source code and it compiles in the background.
 guobao:you can convert to rpm from deb
 Matej (passive):Suggestion (for now): we distribute only .tgz (we have not time), individuals can do binaries for Win, MacOSX and debian packages.
 guobao:ok
 Matej (passive):e.g. BNL will do debian package (they have it for EPICS base)
 guobao:how to name version?
 RESOLUTION: when we formalize distribution C++ release will be source only in .tgz
 JR: will talk to PG about monitoring example
 GW: next week can demonstrate some services 
 GW: do we have a license and patent specialist?
 MK: pvIOCJava has XML parser for records
 GW: XML files for services , users wanted help for services in service definition
 GW: if attributes are added to the XML files, the XML should have a schema for validation
 Matej (passive):DTD is history.
 guobao:I would not suggest to design a XML schema
 guobao:Once it is done, it is hard to extend it
 GW: future binary XML protocol would look at schema 
 guobao:Sorry I can not go
 Gregory White:bye
