<h1>Marty's Issues and Notes of EPICS V4 Development</h1>

<h2>Documentation Standards</h2>

<p>What is the difference between documentation of a software component of EPICS V4, and
its specification. Will there be a difference?</p>

<p>What are the documentation standards?</p>

<p>There already are several separate mercurial projects. Will each keep it's
own set of documentation?</p>

<p>We have a combination of Java, C++, and Python. Java and Pythgon each have
documentation standards. As far as I know C++ does not.</p>

<p>For java pvDataJava, etc use the eclipse javadoc generator to produce html
documentation. I think channelFinder and pvManager both use maven to produce
the documentation. What will be the standard? What are the standards for
project and package overviews?</p>

<p>What about documentation guidelines for C++?</p>

<h2>Licensing</h2>

<p>What is the status?</p>

<p>Source files carry license, or refer to a license? This goes with 
documentation stndards above.</p>

<p>GW: Suggest all source carries a standard header but that it is functional - 
it describes the file, authorship and modifications their authors and dates. 
It only should refer to a license page elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Release Naming and Project Dependences</h2>

<p>There are already quite a few separate projects. If each service is a
separate project there will be even more. This compatiblity problems must be
addressed.</p>

<p>There seems to be agreement on the following</p>
<ol>
  <li>Releases will be named x.y.z. First release of pvDayta, etc will be named
    1.0.0</li>
  <li>x will be incremented when and only when the network protocol changes</li>
  <li>When x changes all projects that communicate with each other must have a
    new release.</li>
</ol>

<p>MK: But what about y and z? There are at least two issues.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>introspection changes</dt>
    <dd>If two services communicate and the introspection interface for data
      passed between them changes they may require new releases</dd>
  <dt>multiple projects within a single process</dt>
    <dd>If the projects both use a common jar (Java) or shared library (C++)
      then the projects must share the same release of the jar or shared
    library</dd>
</dl>

<p>GW: Suggest major, minor, dot. MAJOR is not forward compatible, minor is not backward compatible.
Don't make it depedent on network protocol specifically, nor introspection specifically. There 
will be anumber of things in each class. </p>


<h2>PVAccess protocol</h2>

<p>MK: Is it ready to be declared normative document?</p>
<p>GW: Is it ready to be published as a FPWD - we voted yes. Is it normative? - The way I use 
"Normative" indicates intention more than readiness. A standard is normative if you 
intend it to be. Normative means basically a formal spec. If we say a pvData "is"
normative - we are making a statement about the documentation, openness, and formality of
its specification.</p>

<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<p>To help motivate the next sections lets consider some use cases. Others
(GW, GS, BD) should suggest some. E.g.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Collect beam synchronous data at 10 Hz.</li>
  <li>Collect a set of turn by turn data.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each use case discuss:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>what client gets</dt>
    <dd>What is presented on a OPI screen or what is given to an archive
      service.</dd>
  <dt>data sources</dt>
    <dd>What is real time data from IOCS. What comes from database. What
      control messages have to be passed to IOCs</dd>
  <dt>services</dt>
    <dd>What are the actual services.</dd>
</dl>


<h2>Aida architecture</h2>

<p>Topics include:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>What is a service</dt>
    <dd>Is it a process or a thread or a combination of both? </dd>
  <dt>How many services?</dt>
    <dd>Just rough estimate. Is the number still growing?</dd>
  <dt>Where are services located</dt>
    <dd>Is each service network addressable? If yes it it via corba or WEB
      services or both or others?</dd>
  <dt>How is data transfered between services</dt>
    <dd>If corba is it via IDLs or "corba any" or a combination? If within a
      process then how? If " corba any" how does service introspect?</dd>
</dl>

<h2>pvServices architecture</h2>

<h3>Uses cases for services</h3>
<p>Need to make everyone clear on the use cases of services, which motivates then the architecture.</p>

<p>To make this managable first consider services based on magnets and bpms.</p>

<p>Some topics are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>sources of data</dt>
    <dd>What does an IOC provide? What does a database provide? What do other
      services provide?</dd>
  <dt>what is being serviced?</dt>
    <dd>An entire machine like a storage ring is one example. A local bump is
      another</dd>
  <dt>magnet related services</dt>
    <dd>What is a complete set?</dd>
  <dt>bpm related services</dt>
    <dd>What is a complete set?</dd>
  <dt>What is generic and what is site specific</dt>
    <dd>Some things must have knowledge of specific machine. But what?</dd>
</dl>

<p>Other services to discuss?</p>

<p>How is data made network available. We already have a combination of WEB
services, caV3 and pvAccess. Is this it? </p>

<h3>Source code organization in pvService</h3>

<p>Presently both the core "support for" services, ie org.epics.pvService.rpc, and
essentially prototype frameworks for services, and services themeselves, are all 3
in org.epics.pvService! Need to spearate core, from frameworks, from services. </p>


<h2>Data Types and pvManager</h2>

<p>A suggestion was made that standard types be provided as pvManager types.</p>

<p>What does this mean? </p>

<p>Take VDouble for example.</p>

<p>Is this what defines VDouble?</p>
<pre>    public interface VDouble extends Scalar&lt;Double&gt;, Alarm, Time, Display {}
    ...
    public interface Scalar&lt;T&gt; {
        T getValue();
    }
    public interface Alarm {
        AlarmSeverity getAlarmSeverity();
        AlarmStatus getAlarmStatus()
    }
    ....</pre>

<p>Or is VDouble defined via metadata syntax?</p>
<pre>    structure VDouble
        double value
        alarm alarm
        timeStamp timeStamp
        display display</pre>

<p>GW: Alarm and timestamp are controls ideas, they have no place in defining any
kind of double used at a high level, any more than theweb service your bank offers
encodes timestamp and alarm when it sends you the amounts of transactions. </p>

<p>And why would standard types be defined in terms of pvManager anyway? Surely
it's pvManager's job to understand the normative aggregate types and normative functional 
types, not the other way around.</p>
 
<p>Five basic data types which come from the epicsV3 DBR types are enum,
timeStamp, alarm, display, and control. Both pvManager and pvData (called
properties) provide alternate ways to package what is in the DBR types defined
in EPICS V3. But they do it in different ways.</p>

<p>What other standard data types will the charter define?</p>

<p>It looks like are least statistics, table, and image.</p>

<p>What about others?</p>


<p>GW: I think we need to define a taxonomy: type (Field, PVField), display
"V<types>", aggregate type (table, multi-channel array, possibly image data
too). Those would be nomative. On top of the normative types we <strong>might
</strong> also suggest non-normative functional types: archive data retrival record,
bpm orbit data, Twiss Parameters, Transfer Matrix, etc</p>
