Colleagues,

*Michel* can you join us for this one, re 4 below?

Please find below the agenda for our weekly EPICS V4 telecon [1]. We'll use
Etherpad for minutes. *Ralph*, which URL should we use for that? Is [2] right, or will
it be one for this specific meeting?

Let's leave matters around the prefix naming ca: pva: and Andrew's proposal etc 
until next week. Don't think it's ready for taking up.
 
Agenda
======
1. easyPVA review [3]. Marty, Matej, 20 minutes. 

   Looks good. Quick walk through. I saw a couple of things. 
   Please let us know status (is there any implementation?). 

2. easierPVA [4], James, 20 minutes

   Let's take a first look.

3. The Unsigned API [5]. David vs Marty. 15 minutes. 

   Can David seriously commit to producing Java and C++ implementations?
   If so, then we can consider a comparison of implementations.
   If not, then I think Marty has to just proceed. Which would be good
   because maybe then we get David to do a bpm orbit service using gather? 
   Just day dreamin!

4. Time specification standardisation. T00:10 

    Draft resolution like: We recommend that EPICS V4 systems use ISO 8601 format
    and that takers of a time SHOULD process ending Z according to that standard.

5. pvAccess protocol 2nd PWD readiness. Matej 10 mins.


Greg, for Bob and Greg
