Colleagues,

Please find below the agenda for our weekly EPICS V4 telecon [1]. Minutes
in titanpad [2]. 

Again hopefully a short meeting. Let's get some status updates with respect to services.
Matej, you can also give us an update on pvAccess.

0. Preliminaries (5 mins)

1. Status of Maser service (*Guobao*, 15 mins)

2. Preliminary thinking on Directory service (*Ralph*, 15 mins)

3. Archive Service (*James* 15 mins)
   What is now published (there's stuff now in exampleCPP right?), what more
   can be done to help a lab deploy an archive service.
   
4. PSI services (Greg, Timo, 15 mins)
   Status of deployment of java (*Greg*)
   Estimate on deployment for C++ support (*Timo*)
   
Cheers
Greg, for Bob and Greg
