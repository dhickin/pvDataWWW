Colleagues, 

Please find below our agenda for the weekly meeting [1]. Minutes in Titanpad [2]. Please sign up
for a login, so minute entries are associated with a real person.

Agenda
------

0. Preliminaries, 5 mins. Bob, you can start the Skype call right?

1. pvAccess Spec Publication. ! *Bob* 5 mins.

2. IPAC EPICS V4 report, *Bob* 5 mins.

3. Status of core modules in Java and C++. Planned release schedule? 
   *Marty*, *Matej* 20 mins.

   Ay remaining issues with PVStructure, PVDataCreate, FieldCreate etc (*Marty*, *Matej*)?
   We need services and all examples (gather, rdb java example, bpm C++ example, 
   channelArchiver) brought up to date w.r.t. the new interfaces and tested by release 
   date (*greg*, *Marty*, *David*, Timo*). So, what date is reasonable, Friday 15 June?

4. Services input interface proposal [3]. *Greg*, *Ralph*, *Matej*, 20 mins. 

   Let's try to agree on the target for Matej and pvget.
      - That for now, -s <server> must be given to pvget
      - Which arg types will be supported? Propose string, int, double, boolean. pvget will coerce 
        given ints to doubles, and given "1" or "y" or "yes" to booleans.
  
5. Architecture or pattern for Dirk Zimock's use case. *Marty*, *Matej* comment, 20 mins.

   Recall Dirk's requirement is a single (v4) PV to encapsulate the values of a number of 
   V3 PVs as a structure. Clearly it can be done with a pvIOC in some high level host. 
   But how much better is it to cohosting a pvIOC and a V3 IOC in the vxWorks/RTEMS embedded computer? 
   If the answer is "much better, but can't reasonably be done yet because vxWorks pvIOC is not ready," 
   then when? 
 
6. EPICS V4 charter exit status (if we have time, else next week)

   We have 3 months to go in our charter. What are our hard targets
   for completion to full "ready for use" status by then. 
   I have a use case list I'll publish for next week. Please let me know what is not going to happen.
   Eg 
     - completed javadoc and DOxygen for released software?
     - These 2 deliverables [4] seem in danger to me:
       i.  A normative document of the EPICS V4 IOC processing pipeline" 
       ii. A User Guide for EPICS V4 IOC control application developers

Next Week
---------
Normative Types 1st PWD
Charter exit objectives. 
Beginning thoughts on followup after this charter.
