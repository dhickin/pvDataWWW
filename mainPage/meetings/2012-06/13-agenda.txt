Colleagues, 

Please find below our agenda for the weekly meeting [1]. Minutes in Titanpad [2]. Please sign up
for a login, so minute entries are associated with a real person.

Short meeting today. Let's review Matej's suggestion for a revised services interface. 
 
Agenda
------

0. Preliminaries, 5 mins. 

1. pvAccess Spec Publication status, *Bob*. 5 minuts

2. Status of unsigned/introspection changes. See last weeks minutes for last weeks estimates.
*Marty*, *Matej*. 15 minutes.
   - Presumably this work explains Ralph's non-compiles of java repos, though not multiple heads.
   - Any other questions on DS implementation sticking points (*Ralph*)
     (Non) plan for Services framework, *Greg*, *Ralph* [3]

3. Services interface definition mechanism proposal (*Matej*, 30 mins) [4]

Matej, please walk us through your proposal. I'm most interested in how a physicist would 
write simple code to interact with it at the most practical level - what would one type in matlab
or on the command line. Would they need an RPC compiler for instance.
