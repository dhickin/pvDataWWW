/>0. Preliminaries, 5 mins.<br
/><br
/>1. Status of core modules in Java and C++, Marty, Matej (15 mins).<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Good to see pvServiceJava checked in. Is it in good status Marty?<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; *Marty* you said the clientExample still fails. Need to let<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Ralph and I know when we should move to the new API, and where to find help.<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; When will we return to the situation of all CPP modules mutually compatible,<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; and all Java modules mutually compatible? Marty indicates this is dependent on Matej [3].<br
/><br
/>2. RPC threading (20 mins).<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Requirements. I'd like a policy for letting me implement a single threaded server.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; At SLAC we found this necessary for integrating legacy control systems, where a single<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; threaded client (as a channelRPC server would be) is assumed by the legacy system.<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Where to implement the threading.<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; How likely is this subproject to turn into a rabbit hole?<br
/><br
/>3. SwissFEL modelling demo (20 mins).<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll show the first pass of modelling in matlab, uploading to a Db, and how clients<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; can then get model data from the rdb service.<br
/><br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; Next week, ezpva review.<br
