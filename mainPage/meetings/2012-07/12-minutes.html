/><b>MINUTES</b><br
/><b>=======</b><br
/><br
/><b>Present</b>: DH, Mark Heron (MH) subject to availability), BD, GS, MK, Michael Abbot (MA), JR, TK, Daniel Meyer (DM), Markus Janousch (MJ), MS, Daron Chabot (DC),Paul Gibbons, Tom Cobb<br
/><br
/><b>*********</b><br
/><b>PRESENTATION: Functional requirements for scan engines and data rates as services, Daron Chabot, BNL</b><br
/><b>*********</b><br
/>Example beamline data rates:<br
/>&nbsp; CSX: 8Gbps, 4 TB/day<br
/>&nbsp; CHX, 4-40Gbps, 4 TB/day<br
/>&nbsp; IXS: ~10 Mbps, &lt;1 GB/day<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; The experimental method very often involved "Scanning", and that most often involves physical motion.<br
/>&nbsp; Motion is of sample, detector, optics etc.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Stepwise<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Continuous (on-the-fly). Involves a single acceleration/deceleration cycle.<br
/>Recently, continuous has become much more common. It requires buffering close to hw. Requires trigger distribution.<br
/>So, need to focus on continuous scanning requirements [for future controls].<br
/><br
/>Places lacking in EPICS:<br
/><br
/><u>1. Reciprocal space. aka (q-space, k-space).&nbsp;</u><br
/><br
/>It's the frequency domain space. 1/distance, not 1/time.<br
/>Crystallography defines teh space in 3 axes: [h k l]. The orientation of [h k l] maps to several physical axes.<br
/>There is direct support of this axis space in EPICS.<br
/>Therefore no alarm, archive, direct control in [h k l] space in EPICS.<br
/><br
/>Many scanning operations are defined in terms of reciprocal space operations, particularly for materials science. Eg X-ray&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS).<br
/>&nbsp;In XPCS the objective is to study the timescales of material processes. These are derived from scanned "frames", often 20K frames/s. Frame acq is very bursty. You have to aggregate each pixel in a sequence of frames.<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;A particular difficulty is in the coordination of the frame data acquisition, and the online data analysis.&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;PG: But can't any process monitor the data acq and start processing on given frame number.<br
/>&nbsp;BD: [missed reply...?]<br
/>&nbsp;DC: The point is there is no framework for coordination. There are solutions, but it's not supported.<br
/>&nbsp;BD: Yes, our objective is to finish a framework.<br
/>&nbsp;PG: Do you want this f/w on the IOC?<br
/>&nbsp;BD: In the IOC or even lower, such as in the DAQ. Particularly for short term.&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp;MJ: There are limitations to the extent one can do that in different exp. setups.<br
/>BD/MJ: Much of the data is 0s. Would be easier if formally sparsified (get rid of 0s).<br
/>BD: Essentially, all analysis that is now below the E DB, is there because the EDB isn't presently suitable.<br
/>MJ: Human interaction is needed to manage the coordination of data acq and analysis.<br
/>PG: yes, but there are ways to do that coordination.<br
/>&nbsp;<br
/><u>Three Biggest Areas of Open Issues:</u><br
/>1. Scanning framework. Start, stop, control of scans.&nbsp;<br
/>2. Online data analysis frameworks (ODA)<br
/>3. Data Formats (HDF5).<br
/><br
/>GW: Question about role of EPICS in data processing...<br
/>Split between data acquisition and later analysis is not more feasible because of the data rates<br
/><br
/>Diamond is doing pre-analysis (visualization)<br
/>Access to the data from user's home labs is important<br
/>Standardization, formats, metadata etc. is important (collaborations)<br
/><br
/>MJ: In tomography, they need the whole data set. For visulaization you need the whole data set.<br
/>PG: That's true.<br
/>BD: This suggests the need for a data pipe that can give data to any client.<br
/><br
/>With a proper architecture, one has more freedom of selecting where the data processing takes place<br
/><br
/>MJ: One issue is that we store a huge amount of data for experimenters, but there are some groups that<br
/>aren't set up to access or process that data (needs lots of computing resources).<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; NEXUS defines semantics over HDF5 format.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>Service for collecting metadata ("gather") would be useful<br
/>Metadata stored in DB and used&nbsp; used for data queries<br
/><br
/><b>********&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br
/><b>PRESENTATION: Thoughts on EPICS4 on beam lines. Markus Janosh, PSI</b><br
/><b>********</b><br
/>&nbsp; Experimental techniques<br
/>&nbsp; Tomography, diffraction, spectroscopy (electron, photon)<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; Scanning of actuators and reading out detectors. Often simultaneously changing external parameter (temp, pressure,...)<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; STXM: raster scan of the sample, pixel at a time<br
/>&nbsp; acq time a few ms<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; Synchronous scanning in 1,2,3 dimensions<br
/>&nbsp; Data rates from KBytes/sec to 800 MBytes/sec<br
/>&nbsp; Require metadata of machine, BL status, experiment needed<br
/>&nbsp; Synchronization in hardware. Eg, the "whole status of the machine on a bunch-to-bunch basis, SwissFEL at 100Hz."<br
/>&nbsp; DAQ as dedicated apps or scripts<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; (scribe disconnected for a while)<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; EIGER: 50 Gb/s for a module<br
/>&nbsp; 8 GB RAM on module<br
/>&nbsp; 9M: 906 Gb/s<br
/>&nbsp; Compression on-module (data rate a few GB/sec)<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>How can Epics V4 Help<br
/>----------------------------------<br
/>* General scanning framework, like sscan record<br
/>* General Data Acq<br
/>* Anti-collision management<br
/>* Simple DAQ -&gt; Sophisticated and easily configurable state machine! [BEN, you listening to this!]<br
/>* Integration of RDB for samples<br
/>* Data processing queues<br
/>* Meta data of the IOC (status, health, ...)<br
/><br
/>Address the different programmer levels/skills:<br
/>&nbsp; + Have a very easy and robust get, set, monitor (one usable by scientists)<br
/>&nbsp; + Provide this in several scripting languages, and command line&nbsp;<br
/>&nbsp; + Have an easy interface to the archiver and history<br
/>&nbsp; + Have a tool to easily/quickly plot data and correlate them<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>Have a plugin architecture and developer tools.<br
/><br
/>EPICS 4 is EPICS V3 plus a platform for (scientific) services, plus possibly a frameork for aggregating data in an embedded IOC (V3).<br
/><br
/>GW: propose two working groups, one for services, one for "base" EPICS 4<br
/><br
/><u>MJ would like:</u><br
/>&nbsp; Collaboration provides reference services, on one platform (Linux)<br
/>&nbsp; Client tools and the framework work on many clients<br
/>&nbsp; Development tool: make<br
/>&nbsp; Error logging: use the pvAccess protocol, mec<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/>JR: Does Ev4 aim to replace 0MQ? Would you use 0mq for high perf, and ev4 for others.<br
/>MS: Most of the main good things in 0mq are in pvAccess<br
/>PG: What about guaranteed delivery. I found not all messages in v4 were getting through.<br
/>MS: In pva you may loose monitors, but you're notified about it.&nbsp;<br
/>MS: in pva you monitor signals. If the signal changes a lot, then some notifications may be lost.<br
/>JR: What should you use when you want to monitor data, like publish and subscribe.<br
/>MS: Lets say you have acq, and it may be bursty, then set the queue length appropriately.<br
/>JR: Ok, makes sense. That's functionally equivalent to 0mq.<br
/>PG: But that's not the case in V3.<br
/>MK: In v3 you can't set the queue length for data.<br
/>PG: I used caput to put to a V4 ioc, and I lost some data.<br
/>MK: Well, you should have seen all. I'd have to see.<br
/><br
/><b>*******</b><br
/><b>AI on JR: Add pattern for Caput to V4 IOC to Archictures Document.</b><br
/><b>*******</b><br
/><br
/><b>********</b><br
/><b>PRESENTATION: EPICS V4 ideas in support of beamline science. Tom Cobb, Diamond</b><br
/><b>********</b><br
/>Beamlines are characterised by:<br
/>* Motors, lots of motors<br
/>&nbsp; - mainly delta-tau, with diff coord systems<br
/>* Cameras and detectors<br
/>*It takes longer than it should to create support for such collections of such systems<br
/><br
/>V3 Useful features<br
/>---------------------------<br
/>* rewireable links in records<br
/>* scan rate changes in records<br
/>* streamDevice - stops you writing boilerplate C code for comminicating with simeple devices<br
/>* areaDetector<br
/><br
/>V3 annoyances<br
/>----------------------<br
/>* 3 fold duplication of Driver, databases, screen<br
/>* The pain of building an IOC, undocumented template macro, etc.<br
/>* Lack of structured data types and metadata<br
/>* Can't create and delete records on teh fly.<br
/>* Can't form explressions in macro substitutions.<br
/>* Concurrency in multiple fields and multiple records<br
/>* syncing demand and readback fields. There is no pattern for this, have to decide how<br
/>* Only 16 fields in an mbbo and only 39 chars in a char string!!<br
/><br
/>V4 ideas<br
/>-------------<br
/>* Objects (created at init) with field list that can row and shrink.<br
/>....<br
/><br
/>S: "example"<br
/>Example of a motor high level interface would be a record composed of a conglomeration of V3 [or v4] recrords.<br
/><br
/>S: How would the "database" work"<br
/>TC describes how a notional next gen EPICS database would work. Describes a 3 tier system<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp; soft support"/intelligent device (a pump) -&gt; streamDevice -&gt; IP port (low levelo IO)<br
/><br
/>JR: At Diamon, we mainly add functionality at the asyn [driver] level, rather than at record support level.&nbsp;<br
/>TC: Therefore, you really only need one smart record, than can be used with asyn.<br
/><br
/>[need this discussion summarized]<br
/><br
/>S: Structured Data<br
/><u>TC would like:</u><br
/>&nbsp; Metadata that can be attached to any data [this is provided].<br
/>&nbsp; Like to be able to choose which fields and metadata are displayed<br
/>&nbsp; Functionality now handled by NTNDarray&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>S: Template<br
/>Describes teh idea of creating device objects from parameterized templates.<br
/><br
/>PG: On metadata, I think that's a missuse. In the stats example, that's data too. Missue of the word.<br
/><br
/><b>********&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br
/><b>NEW TOPIC:&nbsp; Scanning Limitations. Bob Dalesio, BNL</b><br
/><b>********</b><br
/><br
/>Large buffer management<br
/><br
/>Arrays are not supported (only one-dimensional array)<br
/>No metadata, limited support for operations on arrays<br
/><br
/>Scanning&nbsp;<br
/>Handling of large datasets<br
/>Multi-core support in database<br
/>Timestamping from various I/O&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>Requirements<br
/>normative types for images, ndim arrays, nodes of HDF5?<br
/>records that support operations on arrays, tables, etc.<br
/>buffer life cycle&nbsp; from driver through communication<br
/>thread assignment to cores<br
/><br
/>PG: Diamond is defining the scans in Python HL apps<br
/><br
/>How to provide a scan system? A service in the V4 framework?<br
/><br
/>Should the collaboration try to provide an IOC that is able to run a scan service?<br
/>PG: If yes, should be flexible (with a python interface)<br
/>GW: are the requirements general enough to make it worthwhile writing general-purpose services?<br
/>MJ: yes; every beamline has a defined (photon) energy, the reciprocal space is well defined, etc.<br
/><br
/>BD: two areas: data processing (area detector) and DA/experiment control (scan)<br
/><br
/>DC: Presently the scan record is an interface to a scan engine... [more not recorded]&nbsp;<br
/>PG: The service should be implemented in Python.<br
/>DC: Only the interface to the scan engine is important, the details<br
/>ofthe implementation of the scan engine (eg its language) is not<br
/>important.<br
/><br
/>DC: What is it about the real-time OS that you use - that drives it being real-time, for beamline control?<br
/>many: nothing.&nbsp;<br
/>JR: In fact, we started to use Linux instead.<br
/>TK: We probably won't use VxWorks for SwissFEL.<br
/><br
/>********<br
/><br
/>BD: Bob asks beamline group representatives do we need to form a "EPICS V4 beamline working group" (to define normative types, ...)?<br
/>DC, PG, ... :Yes.<br
/>BD: If we agree on normative types this would be a BIG win.<br
/>PG: Normative types for images would be really usefull.<br
/><br
/>GW: Should the working group define normative types and then define scan service.<br
/>TC: Do not push it, start with areaDetector<br
/><br
/>DC: Grey area: what are plans to support framework to get data from HW into the NT?&nbsp;<br
/>BD: Nothing was done in this area. We pull the data to the service. An aggregator can pull data from V3 and provide it in a form of a NT.<br
/>Ralph: What about areaDetector plugin for NT.<br
/>JR: We've aready done this. AD serializes images into NT and sends it over the sockets (pvAccess was not ready then).<br
/>PG: GDA receives data/images over pure sockets (for test purposes).<br
/><br
/><b>********</b><br
/><b>&nbsp;NEW TOPIC: MK: pvIOCCPP Thought about future development</b><br
/><b>********</b><br
/><br
/>pvIOCCPP module currently implements/contains:<br
/>- implemenation of V3 channel provider (no aggregation)<br
/>- service support (RPC support)<br
/>- obsolete header for easyPVA<br
/><br
/>What should pvIOCCPP provide? Most what pvIOCJava provides (3-4mm) in addition to implement Dirk's goal.<br
/>pvIOCJava features:<br
/>- database (set of PVRecords)<br
/>- install (support to dynamicall install/remove PVRecords)<br
/>- pvCopy (utility to access subset of the fields of the PVStructure)<br
/>- pvAccess (implementation of ChannelProvider and Channel that access local PVRecords)<br
/>- monitor (monitor support)<br
/>- support (record processing, code attached to a field of PVRecord)<br
/>- portDriver (V4 equvivalent of asynManager)<br
/>- caV3 (client/server support for CAV3)<br
/>- xml (reading XML to populate database)<br
/>- swtshell (test GUI, ugly, used as debugging tool)<br
/><br
/>Features usefull for implementing Services: database, install, pvCopy, pvAccess, and monitor. In addition some subset of "support".<br
/><br
/>pvIOCJava implements portDriver. Attaches to the fields.<br
/>portDriver does not know (define) anything about V4 records.<br
/><br
/>swtshell - no need to implement it in CPP. swtshell should be taken out of pvIOCJava and redone. Based on SWT.<br
/><br
/>GW: Marty do you suggest next year (after Sep) more work should be spent to fully implement CPP IOC.<br
/>MK: Yes.<br
/>GW/MK: Motivation is to access HW.<br
/>GW: Is it important to run on VME/embedded IOC?<br
/>MK: Yes. We (MK and MS) hope that V4 base will compile on VME platforms.<br
/>GW: Would you still call it pvIOC (when coexisting with V3 IOC)?<br
/>MK: "Marketing people" should decide.<br
/>GS: What about "V4 engine"?<br
/>DC: Naming should be revised (confusing for new people).<br
/>BD: Do we have a standard record set?<br
/>MK: I've done a standard components that build records. I've implemented something similar to ai, etc.<br
/>GW: Let's try to make a list of items for next charter!<br
/><br
/><b>********</b><br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: Beam line directed V4 working group.</b><br
/><b>********</b><br
/>[Group went through the basic charter deliverables that might be the remit of a new beamline oriented EPICS V4 working group]<br
/><br
/>1) heterogeneous data aggregator on epics V3&nbsp; - part of this charter. No normative type. MK: Not hard (when implemented as channel RPC request).<br
/>2) connect ntimage and ndarray into v4 server&nbsp;<br
/>3) actions on images (ala areaDetector, such as background substraction...)<br
/>4) review normative types in light of beam line control.<br
/>5) fully implemented pvIOCCPP for supporting beam line control<br
/>6) prototype V4 record using V3 image-processing record<br
/>7) scan service<br
/><br
/><br
/>MK: Re 5, we can directly access V3 record data (C++ pointer) as CPP caV3 does.<br
/>MK: Wants to spent time to implement CPP pvCopy ("nobody" wants to implement get/put/... support code).<br
/><br
/>GW: Re 1, Not much work if done if done in V3 IOC.<br
/>PG: What about using directory service to build up...?<br
/>TC: XML?!<br
/>GW: This can be quickly done in V4 (as service) in Java. However, we want address Dirk's requirement - easy to do/deploy for V3 developer.<br
/>TC: Wants it all done in the V3 IOC.<br
/>MK: Feasible to do with not much of work: start V3 IOC, and within the IOC you also start a pvAccess server using caV3. There is a configuration file that specifies what fields to aggregate into PVRecord-s.<br
/>MK: Willing to work with Dirk from start of September (done till end of September)<br
/><br
/>---<br
/>PG: Interested in points 2, 3, 4<br
