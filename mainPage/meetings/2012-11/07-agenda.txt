AGENDA
======
0. Preliminaries, 5 mins

1. Beta 2 Status review, *all*, 20 mins

  What are we all up to? What are we expecting to complete any more for Beta 2? If
  so when is that expected.
Will we fix the <> "" thing?
Who will write an announcement?
Suggest we publish tars first, wait a couple of days, then announce.
Want to get input from Dirk on VxWorks port status before announcement.

  Expected beta 2 schedule.

2. Jenkins support. *Bob - can you address this?* 5 mins
   Who can we call on to implement Jenkins support for:
vxWorks build
Continuous test servers

3. locksets and V3Channel strategy agreement, *all*, 20 mins

  Verify strategy for V3Channel w.r.t. writing to N>1 channels: that for the
  immediate term, we want to support the easily implementable case of requiring all
  referenced channels to be in the same lockset (as decided in the BNL meeting).

  And that in the longer term we do want to work towards N>1 IOC coordinated get
  and set (though clearly not of arbitrary collections of records - those specifically
  designed to work within that framework).

4. pvIOC strategy agreement 20 mins

  We have the pvIOC in Java. The consensus of the working group is, I think,
  that the requirements and design of the EPICS V4 IOC needs to be reviewed before
  we port it straight to C++. Marty may disagree [2]

  I'd like to check my feeling of the timeline and deliverable for that work. My
  feeling is that the next charter should have an defined effort to review the
  requirements and the design of V4 IOC, with the explicit deliverable of a
  normative requirements document, plus an illustrative implementation. Further,
  that design and reference implementation would be expected only in the 2014 charter.

  Maybe we'll get into some nomenclature bitchin too
