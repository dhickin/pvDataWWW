<body>Meeting 14-Nov-2012<br
/><br
/>Present: BD, MK, MS, GS,TK<br
/>Scribe: mostly TK<br
/><br
/>New topic: Status for Beta 2 release<br
/><br
/><br
/>MS: Modules are ready, tests pass<br
/>Demo modules need some work<br
/>Should be ready by next week's meeting<br
/><br
/><br
/>New Topic: locksets<br
/><br
/>lockSets<br
/><br
/>1) efficency:<br
/><br
/>Implementation does look like it is optimized.<br
/><br
/>When a link is modified dynamically only the records in<br
/>the lockset to which the record initially belongs<br
/>have their lockset recomputed.<br
/><br
/>Thus if the original lockset has only the record being changed<br
/>it is really fast.<br
/>It just means adding an element to the record list<br
/>for the lockset to which it is being added.<br
/><br
/>2) multiChannel synchronous get/put:<br
/><br
/>There is a function dbLockGetLockId(struct dbCommon *precord)<br
/>Thus it is easy to determine if all records in a multiChannel<br
/>are in the same lock set.<br
/>If so it could do a dbScanLock for one record, do gets or puts to all<br
/>the records, and finally call dbScanUnlock.<br
/>But it must call dbGet and dbPut and dbProccess NOT dbPutField and dbGetField.<br
/>It can not use v3Channel like remote dbAccess does.<br
/>Remember that if any of the records are asynchronous then<br
/>a multiChannel get/put is also not synchronous.<br
/><br
/>This would have to be done for each get/put request to the multChannel,<br
/>because the the locksets might change between get/put requests.<br
/><br
/>3) Force all the records in a multiChannel to be in the same lockSet:<br
/><br
/>Not possible without changes to the dbLock.c.<br
/><br
/>When it recomputes lockSets it looks at the links in records<br
/>to determine which records belong in the same lockSet.<br
/><br
/>Assume multichannel has rec1, rec2, and rec3<br
/>and all are in a lockSet consisting of just itself.<br
/><br
/>multiChannel can succesfuly force rec1 and rec2 to be in the same lockSet.<br
/>But when it puts rec2 into the same lockSet as rec3, the<br
/>recompute algorithm will put rec1 into lockSet having just rec1.<br
/><br
/>Resolution: to use multiChannel, the developer has to put all records in the same lockset. This has to be documented.<br
/><br
/><b>AI on MK</b>: Contact AJ about the plan for multichannel puts<br
/><br
/>New topic: Services<br
/>Produce services that produce image and matrix NT types<br
/><br
/>MS: to produce such services, I would need some data that is useful to demonstrate.<br
/><b>AI on BD, MD</b>:&nbsp; produce some useful data and send it to Matej&nbsp; by next week<br
/><br
/><br
/><b>AI on TK</b>: Check that the next V4 meeting at PSI would be OK&nbsp; on the week of 21st January. Also check with the detector group people that they are available. Confirm by next week's meeting<br
/><br
/>Beamline requirements discussion<br
/><br
/>Database access, logbook access etc.<br
/>HDF5 data handling and management<br
/>Application categories:<br
/>looking at images and matrices<br
/>Metadata handling<br
/><br
/>MK: pvDatabaseCPP should be implemented before multiChannel puts<br
/>BD: that should be a couple of weeks work. We could use that soon<br
/>MK: portable server would be a couple of weeks work. Multichannel puts a week or so.<br
