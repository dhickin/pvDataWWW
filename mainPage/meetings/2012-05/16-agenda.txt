Colleagues,   

Please find below the agenda for our weekly EPICS V4 telecon [1]. 

Agenda 15-May-2012
==================

1. How to get to pvAccess 2nd public working draft (*Matej*)

  pvAccess Spec 2pwd hasn't been published yet (email to tech-talk == publication in my view).

  Need AIs and definitive publication date.

  Ben has made comments, have they been answered?


2. How to get to eget with rpc support done and available (Matej, Greg, Michael)

  Presently eget knows only NTtable, and using an assumption about how to form a query.

  With eget deserialization and rendering examples, pvmangager changes should be v easy.
  
  Need AIs assigned with delivery dates for pvget and its prerequisites. Verify 
  prerequisites are only completion of Normative Types to 1PWD: 

        a. NTQuery or at least a normative pattern for service queries (*Greg*)
        b. NT self-id (yes I know, overdue, *Greg*). 
        c. "NTContinuum" (*Michael*) 

3. Architectures doc 

  I'd like to get the Architectures doc up to release as a normative document and published.

  For that I think it needs references to be added (Dirk couldn't use it to answer his questions
  about how, in code, to collect V3 PVs and package them into a V4 pvData. This is a clearly
  predictable use case, so I think we have to add references and example code.
