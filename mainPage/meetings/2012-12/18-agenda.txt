Colleagues,

Please find below the agenda for our weekly telecon [1]. Minutes
in titanpad [2]. 

Agenda
======
1. Activities and Action Item verification and prioritization.

We are beginning to undertake 2 major new projects; call them "pvDatabase" and
"big data handling". People are already looking at requirements, prototyping and 
creating test data. 

However, we have a lot of unfinished work outstanding. I listed some items that came to mind
in a file I called worklist.txt [4] on our web site. It may be a bit unfair and wrong in 
places, please forgive me, I'm trying to pick up and get a handle on where we are.

Basically, I want us to finish what we started before going on to new things. I'd like a consensus on the guiding principle with which we proceed. To what extent must we finish pv core work, such as easyPVA, v3channel, v3-v4 interop documentation, and items from 2 below, before proceeding with pvDatabase. 

2. Clarification of role of pvIOC Java and CPP from now (beta 2), and up to implementation of pvDatabase. 

I'd like an AI on someone (lookin at you Marty) to write text clarifying what pvIOC is
right now - what it shall be while pvDatabase is in alpha development - and what it is forseen to be 
when a (non-alpha) pvDatabase implementation exists. By "what it is" I mean a functional description of
its role in EPICS V4 in each of these 3 stages. An EPICS engineer looking at our web site has to be able to deduce whether pvIOC, java or c++, is pertinent to them. 
 
3. "Surprising feature of PVStructureArrays" (David) [3]

4. AlarmStatus. Should it be renamed AlarmCause? [5]

Cheers
Greg, for Greg and Bob
