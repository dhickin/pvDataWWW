0. Preliminaries (10 mins)

1. Directory service requirement for services (Greg, 20 mins)

   More to follow tomorrow. Following on from the meeting last week [1]
   for requirements to satisfy the simple client access tool (#14) [2], we
   need to work out the implied requirements for a directory
   service for services, so RPC service clients can contact the 
   appropriate service without knowing which service is responsible for a
   given query/pV. In particular, is ChannelFinder appropriate. 
   I'm looking for a basic solution or whether I should write it from scratch.

2. Mercurial/Maven and all that jazz (Gabriele, 20 min)

   + CIS utility over and above unit and iterop tests just run ad hoc
   + SCM Help for the hard of thinking. Eclipse and command line help
   + Automatic web update
   + Thoughts for full development and programmers guide
   + Considerations for users of Epics v4, as opposed to us

3. Charter vote (20 mins, Greg)

   Please read the charter. I'll fix up and send out another version with 
   TBDs filled in tomorrow. Take a vote to approve that we're all agreed.

4. Heads up on Milestones (10 mins, Greg).

[2] http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/charter.html#commandline_impl
    (actiually, "Simple command line tool" is an oversimplification, 
    it's really just "simple caget like tool" but basic API can be used 
    from matlab, python, java, c/c++ etc. I'll modify the charter.
