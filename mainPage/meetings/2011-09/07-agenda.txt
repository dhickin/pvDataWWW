Agenda telecon 7-Sep-2011:
==========================
1. Preliminaries (10 minutes - 5 in future meetings)

	* Roll call.
	* Pick hapless victim to scribe minutes. Starting at the top of the list [4], that would be *Bob*.
	 
2. Review of Charter (30 mins, Greg)

	* Charter [2].
	* Scope - should services be out of scope. I put production 
	services out of scope, but open to comments.
	* Goals include a standard for error handling.
	* Interoperability with EPICS v3. Note, pvIOC for control is 
	out of scope as written.
	* Performance requirements. Is this specification sufficient? 
	Is 80% of CA sufficient?
	* There are many deliverables here. I'll be looking for names to assign as the 
	primary author of each. There will be more if services are put in scope.
	* What milestones? How about EPICS meeting demo of a command line 
	tool exchanging data with a service?
	* Patent policy. What is it, GPL2? 
       * I've been using EPICS v4 as the name of the activity, rather than PvData. Ok?

3. Review of present activities (40 mins, Bob)

	* Well go through what everyone is presently working on, to get a check on 
     present activities. Please be prepared to estimate your commitment level to 
     chartered activities for the next 2 months - including non BNL people. 

	** AI on all **: Please forward Bob a brief statement of what you're working on (if 
     you work for Bob, then in general everything, not just EPICS v4 related). 

     *James*, *Gabriele* - Presently only the command line client tool is in scope
     because I wanted us to produce a way to verify client-service interactions very quickly. 
     But, I can put BOY tools in scope. What then would be the minimum requirement for a
     general purpose deliverable?

Please try to plan for the meeting with:
	Use the Audio optimizer in the Adobe Connect plugin to  optimize audio!
