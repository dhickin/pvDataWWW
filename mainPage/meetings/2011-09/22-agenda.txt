0. Preliminaries (10 mins)

1. EPICS meeting EPICS v4 session agenda (20 mins)

       See separate email to come.

2. EPICS meeting publication milestone? (10 mins) *Matej can you help here*

       Can we be ready to make a First Public Working Draft of the PVAccess 
       protocol specification by the EPICS meeting. By that I mean we've all 
       read it and first comments included, and that it has a header like [2] 
       that specifically says its status is a first working draft. Keeping it
       in word is fine I think.

3. Gather Service Review, *Guobao*,*Marty* (50 minutes).

       Please find Guobao and Martys' document on the Gather Service in email.
