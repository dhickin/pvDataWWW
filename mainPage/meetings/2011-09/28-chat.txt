 Present: GC, BD, MK, RL, NM, JR, MS, GS, GW
 Scribe: Bob
 
 Gabriele and Bob:There is no channelfinder talk in [EPICS V4 session of EPICS meeting] 
 Gabriele and Bob:No
 Timo Tapani Korhonen:hi. just joined in from another meeting.
 Gabriele and Bob:Ah, we can't write at the same time...
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob: I agree
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob: I thought I was trying to give that
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob: did you look at the slides I sent?
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob: isn't that an introduction?
 James:Looks good, I'd suggest putting in a slide explaining what V4 adds before showing the architecture of a full system:- Runtime structured data types and serialization format- network protocol that supports these types- new message exchange patterns such as putprocessget and RPC (if you want to make the distinction). Lack of request / response is a hard limit on the type of service that V3 can provide- quick reason for not choosing everyone's favorite alternatives (corba, ICE, SOAP)
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob: uh?
 James:Sorry I just copied that from an email
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob *looks surprised*
 Gabriele and Bob:That this is not simple enough
 Gabriele and Bob:Who?
 James:Bob's slide 4 is the whole system diagram. Start with what V4 is for
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob: ok
 James:Slide 16 is about history, doesn't say what V4 does over and above V3
 Gabriele and Bob:Right
 Gabriele and Bob:The pvManager talk is a simple introduction on how to use it...
 Matej:http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/pvAccess_Protocol_Specification.html
 James:Not how to use it, just a slide saying what it does
 James:Yes briefly why not ICE etc
 James:And things it's similar to like ICE
 Nikolay:I would suggest to avoid it ...
 James:Yes major point
 Nikolay:EPICS vs Google ?
 James:Does that mean insterting pad bytes in the byte buffer for alignment?
 James:could you use qemu?
 Gregory White:what's qemu?
 James:I don't mind the lack of unsigned types as long as they don't appear in the IOC either
 James:ASCII only is my preference
 James:UTF-8 covers all of unicode
 Gabriele and Bob:UTF-8 does not cover all of unicode...
 James:If you don't look decode the multi-byte characters then it doesn't affect the protocol
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob: compression is good
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob: we are happy
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob: resolution: we shall be happy
 Gabriele and Bob:Matej
 Gabriele and Bob:Ok, Bob
 Gabriele and Bob:Bob is agreeing
 Gabriele and Bob:Next week, at the meeting
 Gabriele and Bob:Resolution: we'll publish next week
 Gabriele and Bob:He is already
 James:Bye
 Gabriele and Bob:Bye!
 Gregory White:bye, and thanks matej
