Colleagues,   

Please find below the agenda for our weekly EPICS V4 telecon [1]. Minutes
in titanpad [2]. 

Agenda
------

0. Preliminaries (5 mins)

1. Structure/Field move and Unsigned status. 10 mins
   + Marty - still plan a subset of regression tests for unsigned? 

2. Platform support (20 mins)
   + Review of platforms now under test. 
   + What have we learnt from Dirk
   + How to record platform compatibility so people can see it.

   PSI person complained bitterly that when he tried EPICS V4 on Windows 
   it didn't compile, and there was no indication of this on the web site. We really 
   have to do better with this.
   Need to assign AI for platform support matrix, and document what one needs compile
   load and run for C++, Java, and whether or not using V3 etc.

3. Maturity matrix (10 mins). 

   Also had comments at PSI that we need an indication of maturity of the
   different facets of EPICS V4. Need to assign AI - probably on me to outline it, and
   Marty/Matej to check it.

4. Performance Measurement (10 mins). 

   Need to get this going. Need to assign definitive AI. Probably on
   Guobao. I thought we had one on Matej?

5. EasyPVA review report (Greg)
