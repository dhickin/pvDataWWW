Agenda
======

1. Confirmation of readiness of pv* c++ and java tips. *Marty*

2. Normative Types self identification, Greg

   Confirm basic plan:
      i) pvAccess id shall carry a namespace:type declaration;
      ii)  we won't invent a full validating type system, we'll use
           XML as the validating type system;
      iii) pvAccess messages themselves will not hold all information to validate all fields of a
           structure, only the terminal namespace and type declaration. Validation of derived types
           would have refer to the external XML schema definitions.

3. Headers.

   What should be in headers for each file type.
   Should license and copyright be inline (per Andrew's suggestion) or a link.
