<body><b>AGENDA</b><br
/>=======<br
/><br
/>1. Confirmation of readiness of pv* c++ and java tips. *Marty*<br
/><br
/>2. Normative Types self identification, Greg<br
/><br
/>&nbsp; Confirm basic plan:<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i) pvAccess id shall carry a namespace:type declaration;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ii)&nbsp; we won't invent a full validating type system, we'll use<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XML as the validating type system;<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; iii) pvAccess messages themselves will not hold all information to validate all fields of a<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; structure, only the terminal namespace and type declaration. Validation of derived types<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; would have refer to the external XML schema definitions.<br
/><br
/>3. Headers.<br
/><br
/>&nbsp; What should be in headers for each file type.<br
/>&nbsp; Should license and copyright be inline (per Andrew's suggestion) or a link.<br

/><br
/>*************<br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: Confirmation of readiness of pv* c++ and java tips</b>.&nbsp;<br
/>*************<br
/>MS &amp; MK report status of readiness of pv* c++ and java tips:<br
/><br
/>pvDataCPP, pvIOCCPP, pvServiceCPP, pvDataJava, pvServiceJava<br
/><br
/>These are all ready, including documentation.<br
/>Tests pass.<br
/>pvXXX.html up to date but still have broken links.<br
/><br
/>pvIOCJava is also ready except xmltest/caV3 fails.<br
/>I just discovered problem this morning and did not have time to investigate.<br
/>Note that documentation has lots of changes.<br
/><br
/>pvAccessJava and pvAccessCPP:<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These are all ready.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tests pass.<br
/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Documentation needs to be updated.<br
/><br
/>Notes:<br
/><br
/>I think pvAccessJava.html needs updating<br
/>pvAccessCPP.html needs LOTS of work<br
/><br
/>Questions about next public release.<br
/>Is the target date Oct 1?<br
/>Will there be interim releases before public release?<br
/><br
/>MK: suggest making a candidate release. Thinks that time is now.<br
/>GW: So we will tag the tips, and build the tar files, but we won't upload them to the downloads directory.<br
/>GW: Who will do tagging of C++ and Java?<br
/>MS: volunteers<br
/><br
/><a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/release.html">http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/release.html</a><br
/><br
/>JR: Volunteers to build tar for c++.<br
/>MK: Suggest same person does both now and during release.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>JR: What about running the tests? How do I run those?<br
/><br
/>MS will tag tips and run tests.<br
/>JR will create tar files of c++ and run tests prescribed by MS on the c++.<br
/>GW will create tar files of Java and run tests.<br
/><br
/>GW will not upload to sourceforge<br
/><br
/>GW target date?<br
/><br
/>GW next week Wed Sept 5th (?) is target date<br
/><br
/>Nominal release date will be Oct 1st. Call it Beta 2.<br
/><br
/>MK: Question on where the table of contents generators is:<br
/>Ans:<br

/><br
/>*********<br
/><b>NEW TOPIC:&nbsp; Normative Types self identification</b><br
/>*********<br
/>GW: Proposes Nt instances would self identify using a string composed of a namespace:typename&nbsp;<br
/>The namespace may be a URI (or full URL).&nbsp;<br
/>But for now no validation.<br
/>So, the Field.ID will be URL&nbsp;<br
/>example, NTscalar might be identified by the following:&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>id = "<a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/2012/normativetypes:scalar">http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/2012/normativetypes:scalar</a>"&nbsp;<br
/>or<br
/>id = "uri:ev4:nt:scalar"<br
/><br
/>URI syntax: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier</a><br
/><br
/>JR: Recommends that we have a type system competition to decide [if we were going to implement a full type system, which it would be] .<br
/>General agreement, let's put it in January agenda.<br
/><br
/>MS: Offers Slovenia for January meeting.<br
/><br
/>NM: What about Oct for outlining requriements for a type system?<br
/>GW: ok, may be able to make that a session.<br
/><br
/>GW: Is it feasible to chage the name of pvAccess field id to something else, since id seems<br
/>to identify the object, not the type of the object?<br
/>MS: No, it's too hard, and I don't agree that it identifies a datum.<br
/>GW: Ok. Let's stay with id as the name.<br
/><br
/><b>Conclusion:</b> We will use field id to exchange datum type id, and we will use the namespace:type syntax<br
/>as written i Aug-28 email as type id syntax.<br
/><br
/>*********<br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: File headers.</b><br
/>*********<br
/>GW: Andrew suggested that we include all of the license in each file. What do people think of that?<br
/>MK: Don't like it for 2 reasons; 1 it's a big header in the source file, 2 it would cause work whenever the license changed.<br
/><br
/><b>Conclusion</b>: File headers will only include a reference to the licence.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>*********<br
/><b>NEW TOPIC: Patches for vxWorks port</b><br
/>*********<br
/>Dirk Zimoch reports that teh patches he submitted for porting to vxWorks, are not in the latest release [so he'd<br
/>have to start again].<br
/><br
/>ie using vector and shared ptr, size_t.&nbsp;<br
/><br
/>MK: We changed the code fundamentally to support these, rather than just his patches.<br
/>So, please use what we have now - he shouldn't find many needed changes.&nbsp;<br
/>First try to build pvData<br
/>MS: Still has to go through his patches for pvAccess.<br
/>MK: Certainly we will support him to resolve these in Sept.<br
