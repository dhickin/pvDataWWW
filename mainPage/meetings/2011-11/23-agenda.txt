Colleagues,

Please find below the agenda for our weekly telecon [1] 

Agenda
----------

   0. Preliminaries (10 mins, if we're lucky. 2nd week of Skype)

   1.  Normative types. 

        Optional or non-optional metadata. Confirm it'll be optional I think.
        Should helper classes and their functionality part of the normative spec, or later work. 
        Completing the basic list of Ntypes (image and others from Nikolay)
        Where should support go (pvIOC or pvUtil or where).

   2.  Milestones. 

        We've done a lot of work recently and we're close to a complete product. 
         I want to propose 2 milestone dates and what they include:

        Beta 1: December 20th:  First version of EPICS v4 that's easy to pick up, install and understand
           + Second Public Working Draft of pvAccess (Matej, Greg)
           + Channel RPC moved out of pvService (greg, Guobao)
           + Examples in Java and C++ (Timo, James, Greg, others?)
           + Getting started guide
           + pvData and pvIOC documentation separate to JavaDoc (Marty, Greg).
           + Nominal Architectures (James - can you make this?)

        Beta 2: March 2012. Easier UI, support for gather.
           + ezpva
           + gather
           + Doxygen doc 
           + Normative Types specification and helper code
           + Architectures.

Cheers
Greg
