Agenda

0. Preliminaries (15 mins). 

1. Review of present activities [2].
   Convert some of these to AIs.
   Assign leads.

2. Build targets (if there's time after 1, otherwise in email). 
   What shall we build and make available on sourceforge? 
   How shall that be built (Maven, Make, Ant). Is our build different to our validation and test support?
   How should building in an institution be supported? The same as for us or different?
