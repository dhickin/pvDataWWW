Status
-----
:This is the 28-Nov-2011 version of the Getting Started with EPICS V4. This version includes Java development, with Mercurial and Maven, and C++ development with Mercurial and make.

With respect to Java development, further versions will include a instructions for people who just want to download a runtime of EPICS V4 (see the EPICS V4 download site https://sourceforge.net/projects/epics-pvdata/files/), and a section on integrating Eclipse development.

Additionally, some language independent sections will be added, in particular for Troubleshooting and a Mercurial cheatsheet for epics-pvdata.


 ================ JAVA DEVELOPMENT ================

This section is on development, with and of, the Java implementation of EPICS V4. See below for C++ development.
 
USING MERCURIAL AND MAVEN
====================

Use case 
-------
You are a Java developer and wish to use download EPICS V4 from the
Java source, using Mercurial, and build it on the command line using Maven. 

All 3 the normative EPICS V4 projects are each in distinct mercurial repositories in the SourceForge project epics-pvdata. There are separate Mercurial repos for each of the C++ and Java implementations of each normative project. They can all be checked out via the unix shell command hg, or using a Mercurial client suitable for your platform.

Objective
-------
The minimum EPICS V4 runtime is composed of the following jar files:

caj-1.1.8.jar
jca-2.3.5.jar
pvAccess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar *
pvData-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar *
pvIOC-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar *

(*) At present we are simply building and releasing snapshots. In future, these will be version numbered.

The procedure defined below will help you download the source for the pv* modules above, plus the caj/jca jars, and build pv* jars.
 
Prerequisites
----------
You must have a mercurial client and it must be able to download from the "epics-pvdata" sourceForge
project. That means you either are going to use the HTTP URI syntax or the SSH URI. HTTP may not work from your lab (see below) and if you're going to use the SSH mechanism, you will have to register with sourceForge. You must have a
maven installed too to do the build.

Download from the Mercurial repositories can be done anonymously (HTTP), or using a sourceForge account (SSH).

The anonymous checkout is using the http URI below. Note that we have seen that some people get a "cannot connect" timeout using this method, while the identical command works for other people. It's probably related to the common practice of blocking port 8000 on the client side, which is done by many institutions for security reasons. Below is an example of how to check out the pvDataCPP Mercurial repository, using the hg unix command via anonymous access:

> git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataCPP.git

Alternatively use the ssh URI below. Permissions are presently set such that only epics-pvdata members can check out or push commits, so contact any one of the participants to get added first:

> git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataCPP.git

See Appendix A if you'd like to set up your sourceforge account so that SSH operations can proceed without a 
password. Of course, for command line development as is described here, passwordless ssh authentication to 
sourceForge Mercurial is not necessary it's just nice. But for Eclipse development it is important because of problems
in Eclipse's Mercurial tools when they come to needing a password from the user.
 
Create your local Mercurial "repo" for your EPICS V4 work
--------------------------------------------------------- 
Having installed mercurial (hg command), create a Mercurial
"repository" for your EPICS V4 work. This is equivalent to a CVS 
development checkout area.

Ref: http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/TutorialInit

Eg:
cd /Users/greg/Development/epics/base/
mkdir v4
cd v4
mkdir hg
cd hg

!! % hg init   <- this creates a .hg file in ev4hg don't need this
% hg clone ssh://your_sourceforge_userid@hg.code.sf.net/p/epics-pvdata/pvDataJava
% hg clone ssh://your_sourceforge_userid@hg.code.sf.net/p/epics-pvdata/pvAccessJava

! easy interface and examples
% hg clone ssh://your_sourceforge_userid@hg.code.sf.net/p/epics-pvdata/easyPVAJava
% hg clone ssh://your_sourceforge_userid@hg.code.sf.net/p/epics-pvdata/exampleJava

mvn command line
MAc's will need mvn.



Download SOURCE EPICSv4 from epics-pvdata into your local repo
-------------------------------------------------------
Ref: http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/TutorialClone

To download the source using Mercurial, use an "hg clone".

Eg. Download the 4 core EPICS v4 modules' Java implementations:
git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataJava.git
git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvAccessJava.git
git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvIOCJava.git
git clone https://github.com/epics-base/common.git

After each of these, you should see 9 or 10 lines, ending in a line like the following:
"842 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved"

In addition to the EPICS V4 core, you may want examples, or "alpha" level software.
Eg, to download the web pages subtree (the directory system headed by pvDataWWW):

git clone https://github.com/epics-base/exampleJava.git
git clone https://github.com/epics-base/alpha.git

BUILD
====
The build dependencies of the EPICS v4 core modules are:

	pvIOCJava depends on pvAaccessJava, pvDataJava, CAJ.jar, JCA.jar
        pvAccessJava depends on pvDataJava
        pvDataJava   has no dependencies

CAJ and JCA's jars are downloaded by maven and not built locally.

To build EPICS v4 core with Maven.
----------------------------
When building you will see warnings, but should not see any errors if the build is successful. Warnings come from both source compiles and many from javadoc compiles. At the end of each "mvn compile install" process, you should see 

[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The build process involves cd ing to each of the 3 core modules repositories (as they're called in mercurial speak)
and issuing "mvn compile install " in each one

[gregsmac:~/Development/epicsV4/ev4hg] greg% pwd
/Users/greg/Development/epicsV4/ev4hg

cd pvDataJava
mvn compile install       [If this is really the first maven build you've done, this line will result in 2 things; Firstly, it
                                       wil create your local "m2 repo" - a directory usually called many downloads from
                                       sourceForge, plus from maven and prerequisites of maven. But if you chose this path to EPICS v4,
                                       you knew that. Personally, I think it's nuts]

cd ..
cd pvAccessJava
mvn compile install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

cd ..
cd pvIOCJava 
mvn compile install  -DJAVAIOC=$PWD -Dmaven.test.skip=true


The above 3 complete the build of the EPICS v4 core. To compile and install EPICS v4 examples as well, if you cloned examplesjava above, then build it with the following:

cd exampleJava
mvn compile install

The outcome of these builds is that you should see all of the build products in your local Maven repository. The 
default location of this is ~/.m2. So, you can check the outcome with the find command below. 

The minimum EPICS V4 runtime is composed of the following jar files:

% find ~/.m2 -name "pv*SNAPSHOT.jar" -o -name "*caj*.jar" -o -name "*jca*.jar"
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/caj/1.1.8/caj-1.1.8.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/jca/2.3.2/jca-2.3.2.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/jca/2.3.5/jca-2.3.5.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/pvAccess/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvAccess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/pvData/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvData-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/pvIOC/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvIOC-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Note that the results gave you not only jar files, but the sources and javadoc jars too (in the Maven standard naming).
Of course, being maven, you'll also see hundreds more. The following find command illustrates that 
you also get all the source (in jars ready for Eclipse) and javadoc:

[gregsmac:~/.m2] greg% find ~/.m2 -name "*SNAPSHOT*"
./repository/epics/pvAccess/1.0-SNAPSHOT
./repository/epics/pvAccess/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvAccess-1.0-SNAPSHOT-javadoc.jar
./repository/epics/pvAccess/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvAccess-1.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar
./repository/epics/pvAccess/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvAccess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
./repository/epics/pvAccess/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvAccess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.pom
./repository/epics/pvData/1.0-SNAPSHOT
./repository/epics/pvData/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvData-1.0-SNAPSHOT-javadoc.jar
./repository/epics/pvData/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvData-1.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar
./repository/epics/pvData/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvData-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
./repository/epics/pvData/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvData-1.0-SNAPSHOT.pom
./repository/epics/pvIOC/1.0-SNAPSHOT
./repository/epics/pvIOC/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvIOC-1.0-SNAPSHOT-javadoc.jar
./repository/epics/pvIOC/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvIOC-1.0-SNAPSHOT-sources.jar
./repository/epics/pvIOC/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvIOC-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
./repository/epics/pvIOC/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvIOC-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar.lastUpdated
./repository/epics/pvIOC/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvIOC-1.0-SNAPSHOT.pom
./repository/epics/pvIOC/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvIOC-1.0-SNAPSHOT.pom.lastUpdated
[gregsmac:~/.m2] greg% 

Of the above completes the build of EPICS V4 locally. To use it, you would write code that compiles and 
executes against the jar files above.


 ================ C++ DEVELOPMENT ================

This section guides you through the process of building and running an EPICS V3 IOC
with pvAccess server included, using the C++ implementation of EPICS V4. 
That is, you can use EPICS V4 client tools to access the PVs.

The example IOC (out of the box) load a number of channels with different types (scalar/array/enum/calc) and data types (byte/short/longout/float for scalars, CHAR/SHORT/LONG/FLOAT/DOUBLE for arrays, plus string arrays) (a channel list is attached below) You can load your own channels by adding db or template/substitution files and modifying the startup commands accordingly (in st.cmd file)

--

Prerequisites:

Mercurial client tools
Installed EPICS version >= 3.14.12

The pv[Data|Access|IOC]CPP uses the EPICS build system. A basic understanding of it is helpful, 
although the following instructions do not assume this knowledge.

Go to
http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/doc/pvIOCCPP.html
"Getting started"

Decide where you want to place your code. Go to that directory and check out the
source code using the Mercurial tools:

git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataCPP.git
git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvAccessCPP.git
git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvIOCCPP.git

Build in this order (pvDataCPP, pvAccessCPP, pvIOCCPP) because these components depend on each other.


1. Build pvData
cd pvDataCPP
edit configure/RELEASE
Change the EPICS_BASE to point to your EPICS release. Be sure that you have at least the
release 3.14.12. Trying to build with an earlier one is basically a waste of time.

make
(should build without errors. You get a heap of warnings but they can be ignored, I guess.)

2. Build pvAccess

edit pvAccess/configure/RELEASE
Change the locations of EPICS_BASE and PVDATA

make
(should build without errors. Again, warnings)

3. Build pvIOCCPP
edit configure/RELEASE
Change the locations of EPICS_BASE, PVACCESS and PVDATA

make

(should build without errors.)

4. Deploying an IOC with pvAccess support


cd to the exmaple directory
unzip the example.zip file

go to the  "example" directory that was extracted
read the README file. In essence:

cd pvIOC
edit configure/RELEASE. Set again the paths for your EPICS base and
for the pv[Data|Access\IOC]CPP directories. 

create a file named envPaths. This file contains a number of epicsEnvSet commands
to set the correct paths. Like this:

epicsEnvSet("ARCH","linux-x86")
epicsEnvSet("IOC","iocexample")
epicsEnvSet("TOP","/<your pvXXX directory>/pvIOCCPP/example/example/pvIOC")
epicsEnvSet("EPICS_BASE","/usr/local/epics/base-3.14.12")
epicsEnvSet("PVDATA","/<your pvXXX directory>/pvDataCPP")
epicsEnvSet("PVACCESS","/<your pvXXX directory>/pvAccessCPP")


make
(should compile without errors)

cd iocBoot/iocexample

To start the IOC

../../bin/<arch>/example st.cmd

(arch refers to the architecture you have built for, e.g. linux-x86)

The EPICS databases are in example/pvIOC/db directory. You can add db files, templates etc. there.
edit the st.cmd to make it load your EPICS databases.





About the directory structures

pvData:

bin
configure
lib
include
documentation
(all above are clear)
pvDataApp (source code)
testApp (test code. How much of this is generally useful)
test (looks like test scripts. Could these be decribed somehow)

pvAccessCPP

bin
configure
lib
include
documentation
(all above are clear)
pvAccessApp
testApp (test code)
scripts

pvIOCCPP

bin
configure
db
dbd
documentation
example
include
iocBoot
lib
(all above are clear)
pvIOCApp
testApp

Are the QtC-xxx files somehow usable (with Qt Creator or similar) or is this just leftovers from a try?

APPENDIX A: SETUP FOR PASSWORDLESS SSH ACCESS TO SOURCEFORGE
============================================
These instructions were written for programmers of the epics-pvdata sourceForge project,
but are probably general to any sourceForge project. 

They're based on reference instructions at sourceForge [5]. Also, they're written for 
Mac OS X command line, but any unix is probably the same, so for "mac" read, your local machine.

1. On your mac in your user account, execute ssh-keygen and follow the prompts. You want a the file ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub when you've finished (see [5].)
   % ssh-keygen  -t dsa -C "greg@shell.sf.net"

2. Install your key into your sourceforge account:
i) If you can, use ssh itself (see below if this doesn't work for you):
[gregsmac:~] greg% ssh -i /Users/greg/.ssh/id_dsa.pub greg@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net 
greg@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net's password: 
Welcome to *.hg.sourceforge.net
This is a restricted Shell Account
You cannot execute anything here.
Connection to epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net closed.

ii) -> Or, if i) doesn't work, use the manually mechanism given on your Sourceforge Account Services
page. 

copy and paste the contents of your ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub file
created in i) above into the window provided in your account services page [6], as described in "SSH Key Posting" of [5].

3. Update your ssh config file to specify that for the epics-pvdata sourceforge site at least,
use passwordless authentication. That is, add the following lines to your own ~/.ssh/config file:

Host epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net
  PreferredAuthentications publickey
  IdentityFile /Users/<your computed username>/.ssh/id_dsa     <== edit
  User <your sourceforge username>                             <== edit

4. test it
hg pull should work without a password
