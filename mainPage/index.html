<p>This is NOT ready for use. It will become the sourceforge pvData web site.
It will contain documentation and download areas for all EPICS PVData
projects. </p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.anl.gov/epics">EPICS</a> is a set of Open Source
software tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used
worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for scientific
instruments such as a particle accelerators, telescopes and other large
scientific experiments. An IOC (Input/Output Controller) is a network node
that controls and/or monitors a collection of devices. An IOC contains a
memory resident real time database. The real time database has a set of
"smart" records. Each record is an instance on a record of a particular
type.</p>

<p>EPICS PVData is a set of projects all based on PVData.
One project is javaIOC, which is a JAVA implementation of an EPICS Input Output
Controller (IOC). The javaIOC project implements an IOC that is similar
to a Version 3 IOC ( the 3.13 and 3.14 releases of EPICS base) but extends the
data types to support structures and arrays.
This data is named PVData.
</p>


<p>PVData (Process Variable Data) defines and implements an efficent way to
store, access, and transmit memory resident structured data.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>definition</dt>
    <dd>Package org.epics.pvData.pv has Java interface definitions that
      define PVData. Although defined with Java syntax the interfaces also
      document what is required for implementation in other languages such as
      C++.</dd>
  <dt>implementation</dt>
    <dd>Project org.epics.pvData provides a complete Java implementation of
      PVData. It is used by other EPICS PVData projects</dd>
  <dt>efficient</dt>
    <dd>Small memory footprint, low cpu overhead, and concise code base.</dd>
  <dt>data storage</dt>
    <dd>PVData defines separate introspection and data interfaces. The
      introspection interfaces provide access to immutable objects, which
      allows introspection instances to be freely shared. The introspection
      interface for a process variable can be accessed without requiring
      access to the data.</dd>
  <dt>data access</dt>
    <dd>Client code can access PVData via the introspection and data
      interfaces. For "well known" data, e.g. timeStamp, specialized
      interfaces can be provided without requiring any changes to the core
      software.</dd>
  <dt>data transfer</dt>
    <dd>The separation of introspection and data interfaces allows for
      efficient network data transfer. At connection time introspection
      information can be passed from server to client. Each side can create a
      data instance. The data is transferred between these instances. The
      data in the network buffers does not have to be self describing since
      each side has the introspection information.</dd>
  <dt>memory resident</dt>
    <dd>PVData only defines memory resident data.</dd>
  <dt>structured data</dt>
    <dd>PVData has three types: scalar, array, and structure. A scalar can be
      one of the following: boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double,
      string. An array is a one dimensional array with the element type being
      a scalar. A structure is an ordered set of fields where each field has
      a name and type. Since a field can have type structure complex
      structures are supported. No other types are needed since structures
      can be defined that simulate types.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The current implementation of EPICS PVData is only available in Java. The
implementation environment is a set of elipse projects. In the future plans
are to implement at least PVData and channel access for PVData in C++. </p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<ol>
  <li>The first step is to understand pvData. Ask for Description in <a
    href="pvData/doc/index.html">pvData/doc/index.html</a></li>
  <li>Create an eclipse project from the latest release of <a
    href="javaIOC/index.html">javaIOC/index.html</a></li>
</ol>

<p>In the future better packaging in EPICS PVData will be supported. The next
section describes the current pvData projects and also provides the current
thoughts on future EPICS pvData projects.</p>

<h3>EPICS PVData Projects</h3>

<p>The following projects are available via sourceforge epics-pvdata</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="pvData/index.html">pvData</a></dt>
  <dt><a href="channelAccess/index.html">channelAccess</a></dt>
  <dt><a href="javaIOC/index.html">javaIOC</a></dt>
</dl>

<p>In the future the project structure may be something like the
following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic 
    <dl>
      <dt>iocTemplate</dt>
        <dd>This will be a template for creating IOC applications. It will
          include access to pvData, clannelAccess, and javaIOC.</dd>
      <dt>pvData</dt>
        <dd>The existing pvData project</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>network 
    <dl>
      <dt>channelAccess</dt>
        <dd>The existing channelAccess that supports pvData.</dd>
      <dt>caV3</dt>
        <dd>Support for channel access version 3. This is currently part of
          javaIOC. It has both client and server support. It allows existing
          EPICS channel access client to access a pvData database and allows
          a javaIOC record to have links to records in an EPICS IOC.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>Client Tools 
    <dl>
      <dt>swtshell</dt>
        <dd>This is currently part of javaIOC. It will become a separate
          package. Currently some features require that it be run as part of
          a javaIOC process. In the future all features will rely only on
          channel access.</dd>
      <dt>Control System Studio</dt>
        <dd>Hopefully someone will provide the features supplied by swtshell
          as plugins for CSS. But volunteers are required.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>portDriver<br>
    This is currently part of javaIOC. In the future it will be a separate
    project.</li>
</ul>
