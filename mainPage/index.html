<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>EPICS PVData is a software tool kit for implementing a Distributed Control
System.</p>

<p>It consists of a set of projects, based on memory resident structured
data. The current projects are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>pvData</dt>
    <dd>Definition and implementation of memory resident structured data.</dd>
  <dt>caV4</dt>
    <dd>Channel Access Version 4: Network Support for pvData. Note: The
      eclipse project name is CAJv4.</dd>
  <dt>javaIOC</dt>
    <dd>An Input Output Controller (IOC) that supports pvData and implements
      "smart" records.</dd>
</dl>

<p>A javaIOC is a JAVA implementation of an EPICS Input Output Controller
(IOC). The javaIOC project implements an IOC that is similar to an EPICS
Version 3 IOC ( the 3.13 and 3.14 releases of EPICS base) but extends the
data types to support structured data.<a
href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics">EPICS</a> is a set of Open Source
software tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used
worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for scientific
instruments such as a particle accelerators, telescopes and other large
scientific experiments. An IOC (Input/Output Controller) is a network node
that controls and/or monitors a collection of devices. An IOC contains a
memory resident real time database. The real time database has a set of
"smart" records.</p>

<h3>Uses</h3>

<p>Some uses are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>I/O Controller</dt>
    <dd>The javaIOC can be used as a soft real-time Input/Output controller.
      It implements portDriver, which is a facility for accessing hardware
      I/O devices such as Analog, Digital, Serial, GPIB, etc. (Much work
      remains on implementing low level drivers).</dd>
  <dt>Distributed Control System</dt>
    <dd>EPICS PVData provides a toolkit for building a DCS.</dd>
  <dt>SCADA</dt>
    <dd>EPICS PVData can be used to implement Supervisory Control And Data
      Acquisition (SCADA) applications.</dd>
  <dt>Data Server</dt>
    <dd>An application can use the javaIOC or just channelAccess/pvData to
      serve data to network clients.</dd>
  <dt>Gateway</dt>
    <dd>A javaIOC can be the basis for transfering data between different
      types of control systems. </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Features</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>PVData</dt>
    <dd>PVData (Process Variable Data) defines and implements an efficent way
      to store, access, and create memory resident structured data. Although
      defined with Java syntax the interfaces also document what is required
      for implementation in other languages such as C++.</dd>
  <dt>channel access - network access</dt>
    <dd>caV4 implements a version of channel access that provides network
      support for transfering PVData.</dd>
  <dt>interface definitions</dt>
    <dd>The Java package org.epics.pvData.pv has Java interface definitions
      that define PVData. Package org.epics.ca.client has java interface
      definitions that define channelAccess. Although defined with Java
      syntax the interfaces also document what is required for implementation
      in other languages such as C++.</dd>
  <dt>implementation</dt>
    <dd>Project pvData provides a complete Java implementation of PVData. It
      is used by other EPICS PVData projects. Project CAjV4 provides network
      support for pvData. Project javaIOC implements a smart memory resident
      soft real time database. Each field of each record can optionally have
      attached support code which is called when a record is processed. </dd>
  <dt>efficient</dt>
    <dd>Small memory footprint, low cpu overhead, and concise code base.</dd>
  <dt>data storage</dt>
    <dd>PVData defines separate introspection and data interfaces. The
      introspection interfaces provide access to immutable objects, which
      allows introspection instances to be freely shared. The introspection
      interface for a process variable can be accessed without requiring
      access to the data.</dd>
  <dt>data access</dt>
    <dd>Client code can access PVData via the introspection and data
      interfaces. For "well known" data, e.g. timeStamp, specialized
      interfaces can be provided without requiring any changes to the core
      software.</dd>
  <dt>data transfer</dt>
    <dd>The separation of introspection and data interfaces allows for
      efficient network data transfer. At connection time introspection
      information can be passed from server to client. Each side can create a
      data instance. The data is transferred between these instances. The
      data in the network buffers does not have to be self describing since
      each side has the introspection information.</dd>
  <dt>memory resident</dt>
    <dd>PVData only defines memory resident data.</dd>
  <dt>structured data</dt>
    <dd>PVData has three types: scalar, array, and structure. A scalar can be
      one of the following: boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double,
      string. An array is a one dimensional array with the element type being
      one of the scalar types. A structure is an ordered set of fields where
      each field has a name and type. Since a field can have type structure
      complex structures are supported. No other types are needed since
      structures can be defined that simulate types.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The current implementation of EPICS PVData is only available in Java. The
implementation environment is a set of elipse projects. In the future plans
are to implement at least PVData and channel access for PVData in C++. </p>

<h3>Getting the code.</h3>

<p>At the present time releases are only provided via the source-forge CVS
repository for epics-pvData.</p>

<p>To install the software create eclipse projects. The steps are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Install eclipse</li>
  <li>In eclipse select file=&gt;new=&gt;CVS Repoasitory Location</li>
  <li>Specify the following options for CVS: 
    <pre>    Authentication:
              User: anonymous
          Password: Just click enter key.
   Connection Type:  extssh
              Host: epics-pvdata.cvs.sourceforge.net
   Repository Path: /cvsroot/epics-pvdata
    </pre>
  </li>
  <li>In eclipse select Window=&gt;Open Perspective=&gt;SynchronizeView</li>
  <li>Select the newly created repository</li>
  <li>Go to versions and for each of pvData, CAJv4, and javaIOC 
    <ul>
      <li>Find the version you want</li>
      <li>With right mouse button select check out as</li>
      <li>Give a name that includes the release. For example pvDataR0-8-0</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>make CAJv4Rx-x-x depend on pvDataRx-x-x</li>
  <li>Make javaIOCRx-x-x depend on pvDataRx-x-x and CAJv4Rx-x-x.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the future better packaging will be provided.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>The javaIOC project provides a GUI based shell. See Getting Started in <a
href="javaIOC/doc/index.html">javaIOC/doc/index.html</a> For how to start it
with an example database.</p>

<p>Each project has a JavaDoc overview document and each java package has a
package overview document. It is suggested that you first read the project
overview document first: pvData, then channelAccess, and then javaIOC. The
latest javaDOC is available via links in the next section.</p>

<h3>EPICS PVData Projects</h3>

<p>The following projects are available via sourceforge epics-pvdata</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="pvData/index.html">pvData</a></dt>
  <dt><a href="caV4/index.html">CAJv4</a></dt>
  <dt><a href="javaIOC/index.html">javaIOC</a></dt>
</dl>

<p>In the future the project structure may become something like the
following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic 
    <dl>
      <dt>iocTemplate</dt>
        <dd>This will be a template for creating IOC applications. It will
          include access to pvData, clannelAccess, and javaIOC.</dd>
      <dt>pvData</dt>
        <dd>The existing pvData project</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>network 
    <dl>
      <dt>CAJv4</dt>
        <dd>The existing CAJv4 project.</dd>
      <dt>caV3</dt>
        <dd>Support for channel access version 3. This is currently part of
          javaIOC. It has both client and server support. It allows existing
          EPICS channel access client to access a pvData database and allows
          a javaIOC record to have links to records in an EPICS IOC.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>Client Tools 
    <dl>
      <dt>swtshell</dt>
        <dd>This is currently part of javaIOC. It may become a separate
          package.</dd>
      <dt>Control System Studio</dt>
        <dd>Hopefully someone will provide the features supplied by swtshell
          as plugins for CSS. But volunteers are required.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>portDriver<br>
    This is currently part of javaIOC. In the future it may be a separate
    project.</li>
</ul>
