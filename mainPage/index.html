<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>EPICS PVData is a set of projects all based on memory resident structured
data.</p>

<p>The current projects are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>pvData</dt>
    <dd>Definition and implementation of memory resident structured data.</dd>
  <dt>channelAccess</dt>
    <dd>Network Support for pvData</dd>
  <dt>javaIOC</dt>
    <dd>An Input Output Controller (IOC) that supports pvData and implements
      "smart" records.</dd>
</dl>

<p><a href="http://www.anl.gov/epics">EPICS</a> is a set of Open Source
software tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used
worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for scientific
instruments such as a particle accelerators, telescopes and other large
scientific experiments. An IOC (Input/Output Controller) is a network node
that controls and/or monitors a collection of devices. An IOC contains a
memory resident real time database. The real time database has a set of
"smart" records. Each record is an instance on a record of a particular
type.</p>

<p>A javaIOC is a JAVA implementation of an EPICS Input Output Controller
(IOC). The javaIOC project implements an IOC that is similar to a Version 3
IOC ( the 3.13 and 3.14 releases of EPICS base) but extends the data types to
support structured data. A javaIOC is intended for use as a soft real time
controller that can be used for SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data
Acquisition) applications.</p>

<h3>Uses</h3>

<p>A few of the uses are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>I/O Controller</dt>
    <dd>The javaIOC can be used as a soft real-time Input/Output controller.
      It implements portDriver, which is a facility for accessing hardware
      I/O devices such as Analog, Digital, Serial, GPIB, etc. (Much work
      remains on implementing low level drivers).</dd>
  <dt>SCADA</dt>
    <dd>The javaIOC can be used for SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data
      Acquisition) applications.</dd>
  <dt>Data Server</dt>
    <dd>An application can use the javaIOC or just channelAccess/pvData to
      serve data to network clients.</dd>
  <dt>Gateway</dt>
    <dd>A javaIOC can be the basis for transfering data between different
      types of control systems. </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Features</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>PVData</dt>
    <dd>PVData (Process Variable Data) defines and implements an efficent way
      to store, access, and transmit memory resident structured data.</dd>
  <dt>interface definitions</dt>
    <dd>The Java package org.epics.pvData.pv has Java interface definitions
      that define PVData. ChannelAccess also has java interface definitions
      that define channelAccess. Although defined with Java syntax the
      interfaces also document what is required for implementation in other
      languages such as C++.</dd>
  <dt>implementation</dt>
    <dd>Project org.epics.pvData provides a complete Java implementation of
      PVData. It is used by other EPICS PVData projects. Project
      channelAccess provides network support for pvData. Project javaIOC
      implements a smart memory resident soft real time database. Each field
      of each record can optionally have attached support code which is
      called when a record is processed. </dd>
  <dt>efficient</dt>
    <dd>Small memory footprint, low cpu overhead, and concise code base.</dd>
  <dt>data storage</dt>
    <dd>PVData defines separate introspection and data interfaces. The
      introspection interfaces provide access to immutable objects, which
      allows introspection instances to be freely shared. The introspection
      interface for a process variable can be accessed without requiring
      access to the data.</dd>
  <dt>data access</dt>
    <dd>Client code can access PVData via the introspection and data
      interfaces. For "well known" data, e.g. timeStamp, specialized
      interfaces can be provided without requiring any changes to the core
      software.</dd>
  <dt>data transfer</dt>
    <dd>The separation of introspection and data interfaces allows for
      efficient network data transfer. At connection time introspection
      information can be passed from server to client. Each side can create a
      data instance. The data is transferred between these instances. The
      data in the network buffers does not have to be self describing since
      each side has the introspection information.</dd>
  <dt>memory resident</dt>
    <dd>PVData only defines memory resident data.</dd>
  <dt>structured data</dt>
    <dd>PVData has three types: scalar, array, and structure. A scalar can be
      one of the following: boolean, byte, short, int, long, float, double,
      string. An array is a one dimensional array with the element type being
      a scalar. A structure is an ordered set of fields where each field has
      a name and type. Since a field can have type structure complex
      structures are supported. No other types are needed since structures
      can be defined that simulate types.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The current implementation of EPICS PVData is only available in Java. The
implementation environment is a set of elipse projects. In the future plans
are to implement at least PVData and channel access for PVData in C++. </p>

<h3>Getting the code.</h3>

<p>At the present time releases are not being provided. The code is only
available via the source-forge CVS repository for epics-pvData.</p>

<p>The easiest way to install the software is to create eclipse projects. The
steps are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Install eclipse</li>
  <li>Via CVS create projects pvData, CAJv4, and javaIOC<br>
    Specify the following cvs options for CVS: 
    <pre>   Connection Type:  extssh
              Host: epics-pvdata.cvs.sourceforge.net
   Repository Path: /cvsroot/epics-pvdata
            Module: pvData (and then CAJv4 and then javaIOC)</pre>
    <pre> </pre>
  </li>
  <li>make CAJv4 depend on pvData</li>
  <li>Make javaIOC depend on pvData and CAJv4.</li>
</ul>

<p>In the future better packaging including releases will be provided.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>The javaIOC project provides a GUI based shell. See <a
href="javaIOC/index.html">javaIOC/index.html</a> For how to start it with an
example database.</p>

<p>Each project has a JavaDoc overview document and each java package has a
package overview document. It is suggested that you first read the project
overview document first: pvData, then channelAccess, and then javaIOC. The
latest javaDOC is available via links in the next section.</p>

<h3>EPICS PVData Projects</h3>

<p>The following projects are available via sourceforge epics-pvdata</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="pvData/index.html">pvData</a></dt>
  <dt><a href="channelAccess/index.html">channelAccess</a></dt>
  <dt><a href="javaIOC/index.html">javaIOC</a></dt>
</dl>

<p>In the future the project structure may be something like the
following.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Basic 
    <dl>
      <dt>iocTemplate</dt>
        <dd>This will be a template for creating IOC applications. It will
          include access to pvData, clannelAccess, and javaIOC.</dd>
      <dt>pvData</dt>
        <dd>The existing pvData project</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>network 
    <dl>
      <dt>channelAccess</dt>
        <dd>The existing channelAccess that supports pvData.</dd>
      <dt>caV3</dt>
        <dd>Support for channel access version 3. This is currently part of
          javaIOC. It has both client and server support. It allows existing
          EPICS channel access client to access a pvData database and allows
          a javaIOC record to have links to records in an EPICS IOC.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>Client Tools 
    <dl>
      <dt>swtshell</dt>
        <dd>This is currently part of javaIOC. It will become a separate
          package.</dd>
      <dt>Control System Studio</dt>
        <dd>Hopefully someone will provide the features supplied by swtshell
          as plugins for CSS. But volunteers are required.</dd>
    </dl>
  </li>
  <li>portDriver<br>
    This is currently part of javaIOC. In the future it will be a separate
    project.</li>
</ul>
