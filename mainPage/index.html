<p style="margin-top:30px">This is the homepage of EPICS Version 4, a software toolkit for writing the control
system and online scientific services of large experimental facilities.<p>
 
<p><a href="http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics">EPICS</a> is a set of Open Source
software tools, libraries and applications developed collaboratively and used
worldwide to create distributed soft real-time control systems for scientific
instruments such as a particle accelerators, telescopes and other large
scientific experiments. </p>

<h2 id="whatdoesitbring">What is EPICS Version 4?</h2>
<p>
EPICS Version 4 (V4) brings support for managed distributed data acquisition, service oriented architecture, and complex data structures to
EPICS. </p>
<p>
EPICS V4 is composed of a number of core standards and APIs, reference
implementations of those standards in C++ and Java, plus associated other components
and tools. The intention is for the standards and APIs to go through a public review
process, leading to published protocols and APIs that may be independently
implemented.</p>
<p> The work adds support for "structured" data to EPICS records. That is, a PV's
value need no longer be a simple type or a waveform, but potentially an arbitrarily
complex
structure. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">"Remote
Procedure Call"</a> like processing pattern has been added, which supports passing
arguments within the context of asynchronous record processing. In this way services
may be defined. A new IOC design supports the protocol and new record architecture
for high efficiency services and controls.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="home.html">EPICS V4 Working Group</a> is a collaborative effort to
define, publish, and provide a reference implementations for, the EPICS V4 standards. The group is
<a href="charter.html">chartered</a> to provide open protocols and standards for both
controls and services interconnection through a public process [yes, we've been 
very bad at this part so far, but it's about to get much better with the first 
public working draft of the pvAccess protocol]. 
</p>

<h2 id="nutshell">EPICS Version 4 Components in a Nutshell</h2>
<p>In EPICS V3 and before, an IOC (Input/Output Controller) is a network node that
controls and/or monitors a collection of devices. An IOC contains a memory
resident real time database. The real time database has a set of "smart"
records.</p>
<p>In EPICS V4, <a href="#pvioc">pvIOC</a> is the implementation of an EPICS IOC. A
pvIOC is similar to an EPICS Version 3 IOC (at least the 3.13
and 3.14 releases of EPICS base) but extends the data types to support structured
data. These data objects, simple or structured, are defined through
the <a href="#pvdata">pvData</a> interface. So, records are processed by pvIOC, the
PV data I/O is described through pvData, and the client - IOC interconnect is through
a new protocol for structured data, <a href="#pvaccess">pvAccess</a>.  An adjunct
component, <a href="#pvservice">pvService</a>, provides an API for synchronous or
asynchronous services for accessing a set of V3 IOCs and/or pvIOCs. </p>

<p>There are also "extensions" of EPICS V4 being developed,
see <a href="#nonnormative">Tools, Accessories and other Associated Work</a>
below</p>

<h2 id="summarystatus">Summary Status</h2>
<p>This section is a very short summary of the status of EPICS V4 overall, and gives
help on how an interested engineer might want to use it now.</p>
<p><strong>Last updated 20-Dec-2011:</strong></p>
<p>
<strong>As of 20-Dec-2011 EPICS V4 is in beta</strong>. The core standards
of EPICS V4, and their implementations, are complete with respect to
the January 2012 milestones. The specification of pvAccess is at Second Public
Working Draft and ready for comments.</p>
<p>In acute summary, support for managed distributed data acquisition is quite far
along and can be used now. This includes acquisition from EPICS V3 PVs via EPICS V4
tools or components. The basis for services and "RPC in EPICS" is complete, and there
are example services in Java and C++. Largely documentation is up to date with
respect to implemented code. </p>
<p>So, the beta is useable for distributed high level data services. However,
there is not yet an easy to use framework for
Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The primary area in which EPICS V4 is not yet ready for
use is that part which is the core value of the EPICS V3 IOC, record processing for
controls. This is because we are adding to EPICS first, then will re-implement the
exiting excellent functionality in EPICS version 3. See below for a complete
breakdown.
</p>

<h2 id="lit">Software Specifications and Implementations</h2>
<p>EPICS V4 is a body of core specifications, reference implementations, and some
associated tools. The core specifications, we
call <a href="charter.html#normative">"normative"</a>. The normative specifications
will be open, collaboratively defined, and may be implemented and extended by any
interested party. We provide reference implementations for adopters of EPICS V4, and
to test the specifications' performance and effectiveness. Associated other documents
are "non-normative" and no guarantees will be made about them. </p>

<p>A number of software projects are associated with EPICS V4. Some of the above are
in scope of the EPICS Version 4 working group specifically, and others not. Those in
scope are being managed as part of
the <a href="charter.html#deliverables">deliverables of the group</a>, though they
are not considered <a href="charter.html#normative">normative</a>, and should not be
considered all at the same level of release as the normative specifications (Beta at

  <dt id="pvmanager">pvManager</dt>
  <dd>PVManager is a client side utility library, that helps to manage complex
    objects' retrieval and scanning. It allows client programs of EPICS V4 or EPICS
    V3, to decouple the rate of events on the network from the rate of refresh needed
    by the user interface itself. It provides a clean, simple, well designed high
    level programming interface for the problem of multi-threaded GUI acquisition and
    screen update of many EPICS record data, for instance, a table of Beam Position
    Monitor (BPM) data of many BPMs.

<h2 id="summary">Summary Usage Contexts of EPICS V4 Given Present Status</h2>

<p>This section outlines how one might use EPICS V4 right now, given its present
status</p>

<p>It is expected that, for a significant period of time, an
institutional <strong>user of EPICS Version 4 would use it in parallel with EPICS
version 3</strong>. In particular, EPICS Version 3 would continue to be the basis of
controls. In its present state, EPICS Version 4 concentrates on so called "high
level" software services. It provides a framework for fast distributed message
passing. This is like remote procedure calls, but with a programming model optimized
for efficient distributed synchronous or asynchronous processes.
</p>
<p>In a hybrid environment, EPICS V4 is at BETA for use for managed distributed data
acquisitions. See <a href="http://pvmanager.sourceforge.net/">pvManager</a>, which is
a client side tool for making acquisitions of a large number of PVs
efficiently. pvManager is mature enough for use now, contact Gabriele Carassi at
BNL. Also see
the <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/doc/pvServiceJava/gather.html">Gather
service framework</a>. This is a server side software framework that uses the new
facilities of EPICS V4 for services, to help a user define, save, and execute, a
named coordinated acquisition of many PVs. The Gather service framework is alpha
stage software; it's complete, but not yet field tested. Contact Marty Kramer or
Guobao Shen at BNL.
</p>
<p>
Although record processing is presently part of EPICS V4, it is not mature enough to
supplant EPICS V3 record processing for controls.  Record processing for controls is
expected in about 1 year. Contact Marty Kramer or Matej Sekornaja at COSYLAB for more
details and estimates.
</p>
<p>Support for essentially Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) through EPICS V4, is in
pvIOC. So if you have a need for host
level services, it is worth looking there now. You will find complete example Services in
exampleJava, including a complete production ready SQL database access service.
</p>
<h3>Present Deployments</h3>
<p>EPICS V4 is also being used now developing beamline image data acquisition and
storage, using the facilities of pvData for structured data. Contact James Roland at
DIAMOND. It will shortly also be deployed at PSI for back end SQL database access. </p>

<h2 id="softwaredevel">Software Development</h2>
<p>See the <a href="development.html">EPICS V4 Development page</a> for complete
references to code and documentation</p>

<p>EPICS version 4 Beta 1 is available now from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/epics-pvdata/files/">SourceForge download site</a>, as
 Java Jar files and a tar zip for C++. </p>

<p>All of
the <a href="http://epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/epics-pvdata">normative
projects above are each in distinct mercurial repositories in the SourceForge project
epics-pvdata</a>. There are separate Mercurial repos for each of the C++ and Java
implementations of each normative project. They can all be checked out via the unix
shell command hg, or using a Mercurial client suitable for your platform. </p>

<p>Download from the Mercurial repositories can be done anonymously, or using a
sourceForge account, see <a href="gettingStarted.html" >Getting Started with EPICS V4</a>. </p>

<h3>Java</h3>

<p>Java develpment help is given for Eclipse, or Maven. Help for both are given in <a
href="gettingStarted.html" >Getting Started with EPICS V4</a>.  The relevant
Mercurial modules are: pvDataJava, pvAccessJava, pvIOCJava, exampleJava.
</p>

<h3>C++ and Python</h3>

<p>The C++ and Python code also uses the mercurial repository. The EPICS V3 build
system is used rather than Eclipse. V3 libCom is used for threading and
other support. Thus it requires that you have a recent release of EPICS base.
These are the relevant sourceforge mercurial modules: pvDataCPP, pvAccessCPP,
pvIOCCPP, pvServiceCPP.

href="gettingStarted.html" >Getting Started with EPICS V4</a>

<h2 id="literature">Literature</h2>
<p>The following are the present publications of the EPICS V4 Working Group, in most
recent first order.</p>
<h3 id="normativedocs">Normative</h3>
<p>The following are normative works of the EPICS V4 Working Group. That is, these
represent core deliverables of the working group, and should be treated as standards
on which implementations of EPICS V4 should be based. As such, these documents go
through a long term iterative public review process:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
  href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/pvAccess_Protocol_Specification.html">pvAccess
  Protocol Specification</a>. <em>Status is First Public Working Draft</em>
  </li>
  <li><a href="alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes.html">Normative Types Specification</a>. <em>Status is Editors Draft</em></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="informativedocs">Informative</h3>
<p>The following are works of the EPICS V4 Working Group that are intended to
supply supporting material. They may be concerned with tools and utilities supplied
by EPICS V4, but they should not be considered standards or
recommendations for EPICS Version 4:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
  href="alpha/EZPVA.html">Easy PvAccess (EZPVA)</a>. This is a draft proposal for a
  simple wrapper interface to pvAccess and pvData. Presently its status is in
  progress but not receiving work, and when we return to it, it will probably be merged with support for
  gathering record data from many sources (so called "gather" support). 
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="internal">Internal</h3>
<p>The following are internal documents of the EPICS v4 Working Group:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a
  href="Coding_Style_Guidelines.html">Coding Style Guidelines</a>. This is the
  standard for source code to be followed for EPICS V4 reference software

<h2>EPICS V4 Solutions</h2>

<p>This section outlines some general "solutions" provided by EPICS Version 4 (in marketing-speak - basically, what might you use EPICS version 4, for):</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Scientific or "high level" Services</dt>
    <dd>This is the current emphasis. An example is the gather service. It
      allows a gather client to get/put/monitor the values of a set of V3
      records. The data is given to the client as an array. Another example might be a 
      accelerator modelling service, in which the optics of an entire accelerator may be
      computed and returned as a single table to the client. Other examples are
      synchronised beam orbit acquisition, synchronised magnet setting, relational database I/O.
      Such services are characterised by two things: large payload I/O (eg whole tables),
      and the need to ask for the value of a "PV" subject to arguments. These two characteristics 
      are supported by pvData and pvAccess. 
   </dd>
  <dt>I/O Controller</dt>
    <dd>The pvIOC can be used as a soft real-time Input/Output controller. It
      implements portDriver, which is a facility for accessing hardware I/O
      devices such as Analog, Digital, Serial, GPIB, etc. However, much work remains on
      implementing low level drivers.</dd>
  <dt>Distributed Control System</dt>
    <dd>EPICS PvData provides a toolkit for building a DCS.</dd>
  <dt>SCADA</dt>
    <dd>EPICS PVData can be used to implement Supervisory Control And Data
      Acquisition (SCADA) applications.</dd>
  <dt>Data Server</dt>
    <dd>An application can use the pvIOC or just channelAccess/pvData to serve
      data to network clients.</dd>
  <dt>Gateway</dt>
    <dd>A pvIOC can be the basis for transferring data between different types
      of control systems. </dd>
  <dt>Separation of Time Domains</dt>
  <dd>A pvIOC hosted service, or pvManager, can be used to make acquisitions at a
rate suitable for one component, such as a client display, independently of the
refresh or change rate of the events.</dd>
  <dt>Aggregated Data Acquisition</dt>
  <dd>A pvIOC hosted service may be used to collect data from a large number of PVs in
a coordinated way, process it as a whole, such as fitting, or tabulating, and pass these
data on to consumers</dd>
  <dt>OLAP, OLTP, ETL</dt>
  <dd>In general, EPICS V4 services allow the EPICS site to include host level architecture patterns. </dd>

<h2>EPICS V4 Features</h2>
<p>This section lists some of the features of EPICS V4, which make is suitable as 
a platform for a unified controls and services environment for large experimental facilities.</p> 
<dl>
  <dt>Structured Data</dt>
    <dd>pvData (Process Variable Data) defines and implements an efficient way
      to store and remotely interact with structured data</dd>
  <dt>Open, well defined, channel access protocol</dt>
    <dd>pvAccess implements a version of channel access that provides network support
      for transferring PVData, is documented and may be independently implemented and
      developed</dd>
  <dt>Well defined interface definitions</dt>
    <dd>The Java package org.epics.pvData.pv has Java interface definitions
      that define pvData. Package org.epics.ca.client has java interface
      definitions that define channelAccess. pvDataCPP provides the C++
      definitions</dd>
  <dt>Implementation interop</dt>
    <dd>Projects pvData and pvDataCPP each provide a complete implementation of
      pvData. Projects pvAccess and pvAccessCPP provides network support for
      pvData. The network protocol for the two languages is identical. Project
      pvIOC implements a smart memory resident soft real time database. Each
      field of each record can optionally have attached support code which is
      called when a record is processed. The java version (javaIOC) has much
      more functionality than pvIOCCP, which is in its early stages of
      development </dd>
  <dt>Efficient</dt>
    <dd>Small memory footprint, low cpu overhead, and concise code base</dd>
  <dt>Efficient Complex Data Interconnect </dt>
    <dd>PVData defines separate introspection and data interfaces. The
      introspection interfaces provide access to immutable objects, which
      allows introspection instances to be freely shared. The introspection
      interface for a process variable can be accessed without requiring access
      to the data, and what data is transferred is done efficiently because 
      the metadata of the data need not also be transferred</dd>
  <dt>Functional Data Types</dt>
    <dd>Client code can access PVData via the introspection and data
      interfaces. For "well known" data, such as timeStamp, or table of orbit data, 
      specialised interfaces can be provided without requiring any changes 
      to the core software</dd>
