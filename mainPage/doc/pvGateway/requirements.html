<h2 class="nocount">Status of this Document</h2>

<p>This document is used to collect the requirements. It is not complete, and
is intended to be a background for informed discussion and decision.</p>

<p>Once finalized and approved, this document will serve as input for
specification, design, and test.</p>

<h2>General Description</h2>

<p>Similar to the Channel Access Gateway component in EPICS V3, the PV Gateway
component in EPICS V4 ("Gateway") will be an application embedding a pvAccess
server, possibly a Channel Access server, and a pvAccess client.</p>

<p>Its main purpose is to proxy pvAccess and/or Channel Access connections,
possibly across IP network boundaries.</p>

<p>In this document, the clients of the Gateway will be referred to as
"external", while the servers (e.g., IOCs) that the Gateway connects to on
behalf of its external clients will be called "internal". This is solely done
to clearly distinguish between the two sides of the Gateway.</p>

<h2>Functional Requirements</h2>

<h3>EPICS Network Protocol Requirements</h3>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-001 pvAccess Client</h4>

<p>The Gateway should be able to connect to internal servers using the pvAccess
network protocol of EPICS V4.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-002 pvAccess Server</h4>

<p>The Gateway should provide channels on the external network by means of the
pvAccess network protocol of EPICS V4.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-003 Configurable pvAccess Server</h4>

<p>It should be possible to configure if the pvAccess server (PVGW-REQ-F-002)
is started. This configuration should be defined at start-up, and is not
required to be changeable at runtime.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-004 Redundant pvAccess Server Operation</h4>

<p>It should be possible to run multiple Gateways with identical configuration
in parallel, to allow failover and load balancing. This mode should not require
special configuration on the external clients.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-011 Channel Access Client</h4>

<p>The Gateway should be able to connect to internal servers using the Channel
Access network protocol of EPICS V3.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-012 Channel Access Server</h4>

<p>The Gateway should provide channels on the external network by means of the
Channel Access network protocol of EPICS V3.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-013 Configurable Channel Access Server</h4>

<p>It should be possible to configure if the Channel Access server
(PVGW-REQ-F-012) is started. This configuration should be defined at start-up,
and is not required to be changeable at runtime.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-021 Configurable Server Side Network Binding</h4>

<p>On machines with multiple network interfaces, the Gateway should allow
configuration of the network interfaces that its server(s) bind to. This
configuration should be defined at start-up, and is not required to be
changeable at runtime.</p>

<h3>Data Flow Engine Requirements</h3>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-101 Full pvData Support</h4>

<p>The Gateway should support transport of all pvData structures without
restrictions. No legal pvData type should require recompilation or restart of
the Gateway.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-102 Full Normative Type Support</h4>

<p>The Gateway should support transport of all Normative Type (NT) structures
without restrictions. it must not depend on specific properties of any NT.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-111 Low Latency for Large Structures/Arrays</h4>

<p>The Gateway should add minimal latency when forwarding large structures or
arrays. Sending data to the external clients should start immediately, and not
require data structures to be received completely.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-121 Combine Sub-Structure Subscriptions</h4>

<p>The Gateway should be able to combine external clients' subscriptions to
different sub-structures of the same channel into one subscription to the
internal server.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-122 Combine Request Configurations for Identical
Subscriptions</h4>

<p>The Gateway should be able to combine external clients' request
configurations (pvRequest) for subscriptions to identical sub-structures of the
same channel into one subscription to the internal server.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-131 Data Cache</h4>

<p>The Gateway should be able to cache data, so that data for replies to get
operations and initial updates on new subscriptions from external clients may
be taken from the cache.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-132 Configurable Data Cache</h4>

<p>The "Data Cache" feature (PVGW-REQ-F-131) should be configurable both
globally and specifically on a channel name/regex base.</p>

<h3>Authentication/Authorization Requirements</h3>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-201 Local AuthN/AuthZ</h4>

<p>The Gateway should support a local layer of authentication and
authorization, where authN/authZ for requests is decided possibly using an
independent authN/authZ server, but without querying the internal server.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-202 Run-Time Configurable Local AuthN/AuthZ</h4>

<p>The "Local AuthN/AuthZ" feature (PVGW-REQ-F-201) should be configurable at
run-time. Activating a new configuration should not require a restart of the
Gateway. Connections whose authZ does not change by the new configuration
should not be affected.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-203 Proxy AuthN/AuthZ</h4>

<p>The Gateway should support proxy authentication and authorization, where
authorization for requests is decided by querying the internal server, using
the credentials of the external client.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-F-211 Transparent AuthZ Forwarding</h4>

<p>The Gateway should transparently forward authorization changes on the
internal connections to its external clients.</p>

<h2>External Interface Requirements</h2>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-I-001 Statistics Data</h4>

<p>The Gateway should provide statistical and performance data as pvData NT
structures.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-I-002 Network Binding for Statistics Data</h4>

<p>On machines with multiple network interfaces, the Gateway should allow
configuration of the network interfaces that the statistics data
(PVGW-REQ-I-001) server(s) bind to, independent from the equivalent setting of
the data server(s) (PVGW-REQ-F-021). This configuration should be defined at
start-up, and is not required to be changeable at runtime.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-I-011 Debugging Shell</h4>

<p>The Gateway should provide a shell for debugging purposes, allowing to
inspect its internal structures and lists, trace requests, set up debug log
output filtered by channel or external client or internal server, etc.</p>

<h2>Other Requirements</h2>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-O-001 Build Environment</h4>

<p>The Gateway component should compile in a standard EPICS V4 build
environment, using the standard EPICS V4 tools and compilers.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-O-002 Supported Platforms</h4>

<p>The Gateway should be supported on all host type architectures/platforms
officially supported by EPICS V4.</p>

<h4>PVGW-REQ-O-003 SMP Support</h4>

<p>The Gateway should be able to make use of SMP architectures, distributing
load onto the available CPUs.</p>
