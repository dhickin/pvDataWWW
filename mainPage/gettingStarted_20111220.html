<h2 class="nocount" id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
<p>This document describes how to start to develop software using the EPICS V4
toolkit. It's a step by step guide to downloading the appropriate EPICS V4 products
and associated software, and using them to create simple programs using the services
EPICS V4 offers, for services and interfacing to EPICS V3 control data.</p>

<h2 class="nocount" id="status">Status of this Document</h2>

<p>This is the 20-Dec-2011 version of the Getting Started with EPICS V4. This is
essentially the 30-Nov-2011 version to clarify the compile dependency of pvAccess,
plus modifications for the BETA release. This
version includes Java development, with Mercurial and Maven, and C++
development with Mercurial and make.</p>

<p>With respect to Java development, further versions will include a section on
integrating Eclipse development.</p>

<p>Additionally, some language independent sections will be added, in
particular for Troubleshooting and a Mercurial cheatsheet for epics-pvdata.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>EPICS V4 is implemented in C++ and Java. Its APIs are in C++ and Java mainly,
though wrappers are being produced for Python and Matab. This document covers only
development Java and C++.</p>

<h2>The Code Modules that Comprise EPICS V4</h2>

<p>At minimum EPICS V4 is comprised of 3 "core" modules, pvIOC, pvData, and
pvAccess. You need all 3. The
specifications for the function of these is (or is being) defined as <a
 href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/charter.html#normative" >normative
documents</a> of the EPICS V4 working group, and available from the homepage <a
 href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/index.html"> the EPICS V4
homepage</a>. There are Java and C++ implementations of each of these 3. The source
code of each can be acquired from Mercurial. To use them, you can download and build
them from the source, as described below. For java, you may alternatively just
download the Jars. This document deals with acquiring and using these 3 core modules.
However, there are many more pieces of software in the EPICS V4 "ecosphere", please
see the homepage, and the <a href="https://github.com/epics-base/">EPICS V4 Mercurial web site</a>.</p>

<p><i>The verison number and designation may change as versions are released. At the
  time BETA 1.0 release, these were pvData-1.0-BETA.jar etc.</i></p>

<p>Since the development cycle (compile, build, etc) is significantly
different for each language, and to match suitable language API description to
suitable use cases, this guide is split into 2 major parts. Firstly, java
development and secondly C++ development.
</p>

<h2>Java Development</h2>

<p>This section is on software development, with and of, the Java implementation of
EPICS V4. For C++ development, see below. </p>

<p>Since the minimum EPICS V4 runtime is composed of the 3 modules pvData, pvAccess
and pvIOC, you will need at least these 3. The sections below will guide you
through<a href="#getjars"> acquiring them from Jars</a> or<a href="#sourcedownload">
building from the source</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you want to link EPICS V4 to EPICS V3
control data, 2 more files, jca*.jar and caj*.jar are necessary. Specifically, the
  pvAccess server (part of pvAccess above) allows an existing
EPICS V3 Channel Access client to access a pvIOC database. The client allows the pvIOC to
communicate with an EPICS V3 server, i.e. a pvIOC database can have links to records
in a V3 IOC database. To use this, pvIOC, and hence server executables running on it,
  will require jca and caj. These are available from the EPICS V4 download site <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/epics-pvdata/files/">
http://sourceforge.net/projects/epics-pvdata/files/</a>
  or from their reference sources. When we say "EPICS V3" in general we mean EPICS 3.14.

<p>The Java implementation of the core EPICS V4 pv* modules, is made available in two ways. Firstly, one can
downlaod EPICS V4 as jar files directly from the EPICS V4 sourceforge site. Second,
you can downlaod the Java sources and build it yourself.</p>

<p>You would use the jar file mechanism of acquiring EPICS V4 if you only intend to
use EPICS V4's Java implementation (not to contribute to development at all),
and within your own Java runtime environment that does not use Maven. If either of
these conditions is false, you probably want to acquire EPICS V4 by the method of
downloading the Mercurial source, and building with Maven.
Each of these will be described below. 
</p>

<h3 id="getjars">Getting EPICS V4 Java Implementation from the Jar Files</h3>
<p>The simplest way to acquire EPICS V4's java implementation is to download the jars
from the EPICS V4 sourceforge download site, 
<a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/epics-pvdata/files/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/epics-pvdata/files/</a>
<a href="#downloadsite">[downloadsite]</a>. See in particular the README file at the
site. </p>

<p>There are presently 5 jars files available. The 3 named pvIOC*.jar, pvAccess*.jar
and pvData*.jar make up the core of EPICS V4. You'll
need at least those 3. You may additionall want caj*.jar and jca*.jar if you want to
attach to EPICS V3.</p>

<img src="image/sfdownloadfiles.png">


<p>To get off the ground using these jar files, see the examples in the
epics-pvdata exampleJava Mercurial repo [14]. <em>The setup files of those examples
(<a href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleJava/tree/master/src/helloWorld/helloWorld_setup.bash" >helloWorld_setup.bash</a> and <a href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleJava/tree/master/src/rdbService/rdb_setup.bash" >rdb_setup.bash</a>) are written assuming
local .class files, you'll have to convert them so the CLASSPATH points to the
jar files instead).</em> So far only 
examples of the "ChannelRPC" functionality of EPICS V4 are 
included [15], but more will be added.</p>

<h3 id="sourcedownload">Getting EPICS V4 Java Implementation Source and Build using Mercurial and Maven</h3>

<p>Use case of downloading the source using Mercurial (aka "hg"), and building with Maven, would be applicable if
you are a Java developer and wish either to contribute to EPICS V4, or like to use
a command line for your Java builds, or both. </p>

<p>All 3 the normative EPICS V4 projects are each in distinct mercurial
repositories in the SourceForge project epics-pvdata. There are separate
Mercurial repos for each of the C++ and Java implementations of each normative
project. They can all be checked out via the Mercurial unix shell command hg, or using a
Mercurial GUI client suitable for your platform.</p>

<p>The procedure defined below will help you download the source for the pv*
modules above, plus the caj/jca jars, and build pv* jars.</p>

<h4 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h4>

<p>You must have a Mercurial client, commonly "mvn" on the command line (it comes for
free with Mac OS, or <a href="http://jasonfharris.com/machg/">MacHg for Mac OS X is a
nice GUI</a>). Mercurial must be able to download from the
"epics-pvdata" sourceForge project. That means you either are going to use the HTTP URI syntax or the
SSH URI syntax, as understood by Mercurial. HTTP may not work for you! (see below) and if you're going to use
the SSH mechanism, you will have to register with sourceForge.</p>

<p>Download from the Mercurial repositories can be done anonymously (HTTP), or
using a sourceForge account (SSH).</p>

<p>The anonymous checkout is using the http URI below. Note that we have seen
that some people get a "cannot connect" timeout using this method, while the
identical command works for other people. It's probably related to the common
practice of blocking port 8000 on the client side, which is done by many
institutions for security reasons. Below is an example of how to check out the
pvDataJava Mercurial repository, using the hg unix command via anonymous
access:</p>

<pre>% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataJava.git
</pre>

<p>Alternatively use the ssh URI below for "non-annonymous" access. Permissions are presently set such that
only epics-pvdata members can check out or push commits, so contact any one of
the <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/home.html#membership" >participants</a> to get added first:</p>

<pre>% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataJava.git</pre>

<p>See <a href="passwordlessAccessToSourceForge.html">the Cheatsheet for Passwordless
SSH Access to SourceForge for EPICS V4 Development</a> if you'd like to set up your
sourceforge account so that SSH operations can proceed without a password. Of course,
for command line development as is described here, passwordless ssh authentication to
sourceForge Mercurial is not necessary, it's just nice. But for Eclipse development it
is important because of problems in Eclipse's Mercurial tools when they come to
needing a password from the user.</p>

<h4 id="createlocalrepo">Create your local Mercurial "repo" for your EPICS V4 work</h4>

<p>Having installed mercurial (hg command) and decided on the URL scheme you're going
to use (HTTP or SSH), now we'll download the source. We'll create a local Mercurial
"repository" <strong>for each</strong> EPICS V4 module you get. For references, see
in particular [<a href="#hgrepoinit">hg repo init</a>].</p>

<p>First, create a root directory in which to house your repo directories, and hg init, Eg:</p>

<pre>
% pwd
/Users/greg/Development/epicsV4/
% mkdir ev4hg
% cd ev4hg
% hg init     &lt;- this creates a .hg file in ev4hg
</pre>

<h4 id="javadownload">Download minimum EPICSv4 Java implemention repos from epics-pvdata into local repos</h4>

<p>To download the source using Mercurial, use an "hg clone" executed
while in the directory you created and in which you executed the "hg init", i.e. "ev4hg" in
the example above. You will need at least the 3 core "normative" module Java
implementations, as above. The "common" repo is useful too, for setup files etc:</p>

<pre>
[from ev4hg/ directory in this example, created above]
% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataJava.git
% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvAccessJava.git
% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvIOCJava.git
% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/common.git
</pre>

<p>After each of these, you should see 9 or 10 lines, ending in a line like the
following:</p>

<pre>
"842 files updated, 0 files merged, 0 files removed, 0 files unresolved"
</pre>

<p>In addition to the EPICS V4 core, you may want the Java examples, or "alpha" level
software.</p>

<pre>
% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/exampleJava.git
% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/alpha.git
</pre>


<h4 id="javabuild">EPICS V4 Java Implementation Build</h4>

<p>The build dependencies of the EPICS v4 core modules are:</p>

<ul>
<li>pvDataJava has no dependencies</li>
<li>pvAccessJava depends on pvDataJava</li>
<li>pvIOCJava depends on pvAaccessJava and pvDataJava for build. The pvIOCJava runtime
additionally depends on CAJ.jar and JCA.jar</li>
</ul>

<p>CAJ and JCA's jars will be downloaded by maven by your build below, no need to get
them manually, as long as maven can see SourceForge's web site during the build.</p>

<p>When building you will see warnings, but should not see any errors if the
build is successful. Warnings come from both source compiles and many from
javadoc compiles. At the end of each "mvn compile install" process, you should
see:</p>

<pre>
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
[INFO] ------------------------------------------------------------------------
</pre>

<p>The build itself is handled by Maven for Java builds. The actions for the build of each EPICS V4
module is handled by its own pom.xml file, there is no global one. So, the build
process involves "cd" ing to each of the 3 core modules repositories (as they're
called in mercurial speak), and issuing "mvn compile install" in each one. Start
with pvDataJava since it has no dependencies, then pvAccessJava, then pvIOCJava.
</p>
<p>If this is really the first maven build you've done,
the first mvn compile line below will result in 2 things; Firstly, it will create
your local "m2 repo" (in ~/.m2 by default). Then it will initiate <strong>many</strong> downloads from
sourceForge, plus from Maven and prerequisites of Maven. But if you chose
this path to EPICS v4, so you knew that.]
</p>

<pre>
% pwd
/Users/greg/Development/epicsV4/ev4hg

% cd pvDataJava
% mvn compile install

% cd ../pvAccessJava
% mvn compile install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

% cd ../pvIOCJava
% mvn compile install -DJAVAIOC=$PWD -Dmaven.test.skip=true
</pre>

<p>The above 3 complete the build of the EPICS v4 core. To compile and install
EPICS v4 examples as well, if you cloned examplesJava above, then build it with
the following:</p>

<p>cd to your exampleJava, probably <code>cd ../examplesJava</code></p>

<pre>
% mvn compile install
</pre>

<p>The outcome of these builds is that you should see all of the build products
in your local Maven repository (~/.m2 by default).</p>

<p>The minimum EPICS V4 runtime is composed of only 3 Jars, for the core, plus
2 if you want to access EPICS V3 IOCs, so you can
check the outcome of the builds with the find command below, to verify that from the 100s now
in <code>~/.m2/</code>, you have the few you really need:</p>

<pre>
% find ~/.m2 -name "pv*SNAPSHOT.jar" -o -name "*caj*.jar" -o -name "*jca*.jar"
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/caj/1.1.8/caj-1.1.8.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/jca/2.3.5/jca-2.3.5.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/pvAccess/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvAccess-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/pvData/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvData-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/pvIOC/1.0-SNAPSHOT/pvIOC-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
</pre>

<p>Note that the results gave you not only jar files under <code>~/.m2/</code>, but the sources and
javadoc jars too (in the Maven standard naming).</p>

<p>The above completes the build of EPICS V4 locally. To use it, you would
write code that compiles and executes against the jar files above.</p>

<h4>Java Eclipse Development</h4>

<p>To use or develop these, the steps might be: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Install eclipse</li>
  <li>Either use a shell command, or MercurialEclipse, to acquire the pv modules
  from EPICS V4's sourceforge repository. Using the shell mechanism you might:
  <ul>
    <li>Use a shell command to clone the mercurial repository as described
  above.</li>
  <li>If you cloned the Java projects into directory hg/ change workspace to
  hg/.</li>
  <li>In eclipse import from local mercurial repository.</li>
  </ul>
  Alternatively see <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/EclipseMercurialNote.pdf">
  Mercurial in Eclipse cheatsheet for EPICS V4 (PDF)</a></li>
  <li>Make pvAccessJava depend on pvDataJava.</li>
  <li>Make pvIOCJava depend on pvDataJava and pvAccessJava.</li>
  <li>Make pvServiceJava depend on pvDataJava, pvAccessJava, and pvIOCJava.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="javaexamples">Java Examples</h4>

<p>For Java client and server examples, at the time of writing, see the source code

in the examplesJava module. You can find this on the epics-pvdata web site  [<a
href="#ev4examples">ev4examples</a>]. At the time of writing, examplesJava contains
2 examples, both of RPC style servers (that is, pass arguments to EPICS V4 server, get data back
dependent on the arguments).</p>

<p>In particular, you may like to start with the,  <a
href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleJava/tree/master/src/helloWorld">
helloWorld example service</a>. Start with its <a href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleJava/tree/master/src/helloWorld/HELLOWORLD_README.txt" >HELLOWORLD_README.txt</a>
</p>

<p>The <a
href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleJava/tree/master/src/rdbService"
>rdbService</a> example is a complete functional server for accessing SQL databases
such Oracle via an EPICS V4 server, and returning the resulting table ResultSet data
back to an EPICS V4 client. rdbService illustrates:</P>
<ol>
  <li><code>channelRPC</code> functionality of EPICSV4 </li>
  <li>use of JDBC for accessing Oracle to execute a SQL query within a pattern that
  retries the query and can rebuild the connection if any query fails - for high
  reliability and to make sure if the database backend ever cycles, the EPICS v4 server need
  not be restarted.</li>
  <li>Putting complex data into an EPICS V4 pvStructure (the basic complex data
  object of pvData), ready for returning results back to the EPICS V4 client</li>
  <li>Client side calling the server, and getting the results</li>
  <li>Unpacking complex data out of a pvStructure</li>
  <li>Illustration of the idea of using the NTTable EPICS V4 "normative type" (though
  the definition of an NTTable is likely to change soon</li>
  <li>Helpers for trasformation of array pvData to Java Vectors</li>
  <li>Formatting pvStructure encoded data for printing.</li>
</ol>
  

<h2>C++ Development</h2>

<p>This section is on software development, with and of, the C++ implementation of
EPICS V4. For Java development, see above. </p>

<p class="editor">[Check this, may want to say it's on acq and build, then split into
Timo's example and channelRPC example] This section guides you through the process of acquiring the source, building,
and running an EPICS V3 IOC with a pvAccess server included. That is, you can use EPICS V4 client tools to
access the PVs. </p>

<p> The example EPICS V4 IOC <span class="editor">included in the Ev4 download</span>
includes a number of channels of different types: scalar/array/enum/calc etc, and
data types: byte/short/longout/float for scalars, CHAR/SHORT/LONG/FLOAT/DOUBLE for
arrays, plus string arrays. A channel list is attached below. You can load your own
channels by adding db or template/substitution files and modifying the startup
commands accordingly in your st.cmd file.  </p>

<h3>Getting EPICS V4 C++ Implementation Source and Build with make</h3>
<p>
The C++ implementations of the EPICS V4 core modules, pvDataCPP, pvAccessCPP,
pvIOCCPP, use the EPICS V3 build system, based on unix <code>make</code>
(in contrast to the Java implementation, which
uses Maven). A basic understanding of the EPICS V3 make system is helpful, 
although the following instructions do not assume this knowledge.
</p>

<h3 id="cppprerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<p>
You will <a href="#prerequisites">need the Mercurial client tools, as described above</a>.</p>

<p>An installed version of EPICS V3, >= 3.14.12.</p>

<p>
Decide where you want to place your code. If you have not already done so <a href="#createlocalrepo" >create the
Mercurial repo home directory there</a>. Go to that directory and check out the
3 core EPICS V4 modules source code with a Mercurial clone [again this example shows using the SSH
URL in this example, you may use an HTTP URL instead, see Java example above for more]:
</p>
<pre>
[from ev4hg/ directory in this example, created above]
% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvDataCPP.git
% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvAccessCPP.git
% git clone https://github.com/epics-base/pvIOCCPP.git
</pre>

<h4 id="cppbuild">EPICS V4 C++ Implementation Build</h4>

<p>The 3 core EPICS V4 modules <a href="#javabuild" >have build interdependencies as
detailed above</a>, which require that they are built in the order pvDataCPP, pvAccessCPP, pvIOCCPP.
</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Build pvData. <code>cd pvDataCPP</code>, and create a <code>configure/RELEASE.local</code> file. In it
  set the
  EPICS_BASE to point to your EPICS release. Be sure that you have at least the
release 3.14.12. Trying to build with an earlier one is basically a waste of time.
(This file is included from configure/RELEASE with the line <code>-include $(TOP)/configure/RELEASE.local</code>.)
</p>
  <pre>
make
</pre>
<p>pvData should build without errors. You get a heap of warnings but they can be
  ignored</p>
 </li>
 
 <li>Build pvAccess. <code>cd pvAccessCPP</code>, and create the
<code>pvAccess/configure/RELEASE.local</code> file.
Add the locations of EPICS_BASE and PVDATA approprately.
<pre>
make
</pre>
<p> It should build without errors. Again with the warnings! [yea, this must be fixed]</p>
 </li>

 <li>Build pvIOCCPP. <code>cd pvIOCCPP</code>, and add the
<code>
configure/RELEASE.local</code> file. 
Add the locations of EPICS_BASE, PVACCESS and PVDATA appropriately.
 <pre>
make
</pre>
 <p> It should build without errors. Outstanding!</p>
 </li>
</ol>
 
<p>This completes the C++ build of EPICS V4.</p>

<h4 id="cppexamples">C++ Examples</h4>
<p> 
For an example of using the EPICS V4 C++ implementation to create a middleware
 service equivalent to the Java example given above, see the pvIOCCPP Getting
Started document [<a href="#bib:pvIOCCPP">bib:pvIOCCPP</a>].
</p>
<p>The remainder of this section describes an example of the use of the C++ implementation of EPICS
 V4 to access EPICS V3 PVs. That is, a version 3 IOC makes the values of V3 channels
available through pvAccess to EPICS V4 pvAccess clients. </p> 

<h5>To deploying an IOC with pvAccess support:</h5>

 <ol>
   <li>   
   <code>cd</code> to the example directory <span class="editor">TODO: Add in which
   repo, pvDataCPP?</span></li>
   <li>Unzip the example.zip file <span class="editor">TODO: Add command for unzip</span>
   </li>
   <li><code>cd</code> to the  "example" directory that was extracted</li>
   <li>read the README file. In essence:</li>
   <ol>
     <li>cd pvIOC</li>
     <li>edit configure/RELEASE. Set again the paths for your EPICS base and for the pv[Data|Access\IOC]CPP directories. </ll>
</ol>
<li>Create a file named envPaths. This file contains a number of epicsEnvSet commands
to set the correct paths. Like this:</li>
<pre>
epicsEnvSet("ARCH","linux-x86")
epicsEnvSet("IOC","iocexample")
epicsEnvSet("TOP","/<your pvXXX directory>/pvIOCCPP/example/example/pvIOC")
epicsEnvSet("EPICS_BASE","/usr/local/epics/base-3.14.12")
epicsEnvSet("PVDATA","/<your pvXXX directory>/pvDataCPP")
epicsEnvSet("PVACCESS","/<your pvXXX directory>/pvAccessCPP")
</pre>
<li>Then
<pre>
make
</pre>
Example should compile without errors.
</li>
<li>Change directory to the iocBoot example directory and start it:
<pre>
% cd iocBoot/iocexample
% ../../bin/<arch>/example st.cmd
</pre>
("arch" refers to the architecture for which you have built, e.g. linux-x86)
</li>
<li>
The EPICS databases are in directory <code>example/pvIOC/db/</code>. You can add db files, templates etc. there.
Edit the st.cmd to make it load your EPICS databases.
</li>
</ol>
