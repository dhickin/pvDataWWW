      <p>This document describes the administrative processes of the EPICS V4 Working
      Group.</p>

        <p>The EPICS V4 Working Group is a collaboration of software engineers and
  physicists involved in the design and implementation of the next major version of
  EPICS.  
  </p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The process is described by a list of practices and required documents, given in
  approximately the chronological order in which they are used.</p>

  <h2>Working Group</h2>

  <p>The collaboration between individuals working on EPICS Version 4, is formalised
  as Working Group. As such it has definite participants, who are responsible for the
  deliverables; and observers, who partake in policy and meetings, but are not
  required to deliver work. </p> <p> Participants are expected to contribute 20-30%
  of their time on the activities of the Working Group. Participants MUST get active
  approval from their home institution, in writing, delivered to the <a
   href="chairs">chairs<a/>.</p>

  <h2>Chairs</h2>
  
  <p>One or two individuals take the role of chairs of the Working Group. They draft
  the <a href="charter">charter</a> and are responsible for the charter success criteria. Specific
  activities of the chairs will include assigning roles to group members, meeting
  agenda, making sure meetings are productive, deciding on the mechanism of action item, issue, and resolution
  recording (see below), arbitration and the role of final "decider." </p>

  <h2>Charter</h2>

  <p>A Charter document is prepared which defines the duration, deliverables, success
  criteria, scope (including items out of scope), and funding, of the Working
  Group. The charter is intended to be the basis for agreement of objectives between
  the collaborating institutions, and between employers and employees about their
  EPICS Working Group commitment.  </p>

  <h2>Meetings</h2>
  
  <p>Telecon meetings should be held every week or close to that schedule.</p>

  <p>Face-to-face meetings should be held, for one or two days, on an approximately
  quarterly schedule, or as activities require.</p>
  
  <p>Minutes of all meeting should be recorded in some detail and be available for
  reference among the members and other parties to the charter such as managers and
  EPICS leadership. </p>

  <h2>Formal activity tracking</h2>

  <p>Some activities of the working group should be formally and openly tracked, so
  that the group can itself administer its own activity and decisions effectively,
  and so that home institutions and the EPICS community in general can monitor
  activity. In particular the following should be tracked: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>ACTION ITEMS: Action Items are small specific and defined deliverables, such
  as for a piece of software, a document, or similar work. AIs are specifically
  assigned to an group member with a delivery date </li>
  <li>RESOLUTIONS: Decisions of the working group, such as which alternative from a
  choice of designs was selected, should be recorded and written as a resolution. In
  this way, the matter decided can be clearly explained, and the choice made
  explicit</li>
  <li>ISSUES: Problematic areas of work should be identified as recorded. In this way
  the Working Group keeps track of things they will have to deal with </li>
  <li>BUGS: Software bugs should be tracked.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Software</h2>

    <p>The source code products of the Working Group should be made available to the
    public, with reference to the EPICS License. </p>

    <p>All source code should be accompanied by programmers guidance documentation,
    and should also be accompanied by fully marked up source code reference
    documentation such as Doxygen (C++) or JavaDoc (java). </p>

    <p>Very clear instructions about how to acquire, build, and link software,
    should be clearly visible in the group's web site. Prerequisites of the software
    must be clear. </p>
    
    <p>All software should be managed in a Source Code Management system. Releases
    should be made including unit tests, ideally within a Continuous Integration
    Management system.</p>

    <p>The association of software implementation version with the version or
    versions of the <a href="#normative" >normative documents</a> on which that
    software is associated, should be very clear, and made explicit on the web
    site. </p>

  <h2>Public Web Site</h2>

    <p>The working group should maintain a public web site, where software and
    document products can be found easily.</p>

    <p>The maturity and status of each working group product
    must be clearly indicated on the web site. </p>

    <p>The web site must make clear to the public how to contact the working group,
    how to provide feedback to the group and how to report bugs in software and
    specifications. SourceForge is a reasonable platform for the web site.</p>

  <h2>Specifications and the "Normative" Document Classification</h2>
    
    <p id="normative">Documents that define a specifications of a standard or design being proposed
    by the Working Group for EPICS, should themselves be written according to a
    standard. We will call such documents "Normative". Normative documents MUST all
    follow the same <a href="templates/epicsv4_document.html" >template</a>, which
    specifies inclusion of text that indicates the status and provenance of the
    document.</p>

    <p>Normative specifications or designs for software (or hardware)
    should be accompanied by a reference implementation.</p>

  <h2>Normative Document Development and Publication Process</h2>

    <p>Normative documents should go through the following iterative collaboration
    procedure. This is to ensure that the EPICS community has good opportunity to
    comment and refine the spec, the final product is broadly useful, and weak or
    unnecessary specs get dropped. </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Editors Draft. This status is used while the writers and editors just develop the spec inside the
    Working Group. Editors Draft status indicates the spec is not ready to be
    reviewed</li>
    <li>First Public Working Draft. The document is ready for initial review. </li>
    <li>Successive "Second", "Third" etc Public Working Draft. As the document is
    refined, it should be republished to Tech-talk etc, as numbered and dated working
    drafts. </li>
    <li>Last Call. When the working group is satisfied that it has a draft which can
    form the basis for an EPICS standard, it should publish a Last Call draft. The
    Working Group should publish this to Tech-talk and be prepared to record their
    responses to all comments (such as in a mailing list). </li>
    <li>When the WG is confident that its spec is ready, it should petition Bob
    Dalesio and Andrew Johnson to publish the spec as a Recommendation</li>
    <li>Recommendation. This status indicates the EPICS community and leaders have
    accepted the specification and associated software, if any, as part of EPICS, and
    recommend that other activities build on it.</li>
    </ol>
