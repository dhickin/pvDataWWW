<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>How arrays are implemented has a big impact on performance and memory usage.
areaDetector applications are a good example.
A detector image can have hundreds of megaPixels.
If each areaDetector plugin, each channelMonitor, etc has it's own copy of the image
than a lot of memory is required and a lot of time will be spent copying data between
the various copies of the image.
</p>
<p>
This document describes how arrays are currently implemented
and then discuss possible improvements.
pvDataCPP already has good support for scalarArray data but some problems remain
for union, unionArray, and structureArray fields.
pvDataJava has no good support for improving array performance and memory usage.
</p>
<p>This introduction provides the background for the remaining sections.</p>
<h3>Monitor</h3>
<p>pvAccess monitors provide a good example of how memory and performance can
be impacted by implementation.
</p>
<p>Monitor are implemented via a finite queue of monitorElements.
A channel connects to a PVRecord in a pvAccess server.
The PVRecord has a pvStructure that has the data provided by the server.
The monitor implementation creates a monitorElement queue and is the producer, i. e. it puts things
into the queue. The client is the consumer, i. e. it takes monitorElements out of the queue.
When the producer is created it allocates a monitorElement queue.
A monitorElement queue has the following methods:</p>
<pre>
MonitorElement getFree();
void setUsed(MonitorElement element);
MonitorElement getUsed();
void releaseUsed(MonitorElement element);
</pre>
where
<dl>
   <dt>getFree</dt>
     <dd>
      Called by producer to get an unused element.
      If a null is returned then the queue is full.
     </dd>
   <dt>setUsed</dt>
     <dd>
      Called by the producer to set element as used.
     </dd>
   <dt>getUsed</dt>
     <dd>
       Called by consumer to get the next used element.
      If a null is returned there are no more used elements.
     </dd>
   <dt>releaseUsed</dt>
     <dd>
      Called by the consumer to release the element returned by the call to getUsed.
     </dd>
</dl>
<p>Important Notes:</p>
<ul>
   <li>
     A producer can only modify a monitor element between
      calls to getFree and setUsed.
    </li>
    <li>
     A client can only access the values in a monitor element between
     calls to getUsed and releaseUsed.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
When the producer is active it always owns one element of the queue.
If the consumer does not keep up the producer keeps using
the element it owns (This is the reason for the overrun bitSet).
Since at any given time the consumer may or may not own a monitorElement,
the queue size must be at least two,
one for the producer and one for the consumer.</p>
<p>A MonitorElement has the following:</p>
<pre>
monitorElement
    PVStructure pvStructure
    BitSet changedBitSet
    BitSet overrunBitSet
</pre>
where
<dl>
   <dt>pvStructure</dt>
     <dd>A pvStructure with fields that are subset of the fields in the PVStructure of the PVRecord.
      pvCopy described below copies data between the two pvStructures.
      </dd>
   <dt>changedBitSet</dt>
     <dd>Set by the provider to show which fields have changed value since the previous monitor.
     </dd>
   <dt>overrunBitSet</dt>
     <dd>Set by the provider to show which fields have changed value more than once
       since the previous monitor.
     </dd>
</dl>
<p>Comments:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
    Since each monitor has allocated at least two monitorElements it has
    allocated at least two pvStructures.
    If one of the fields of each pvStructure is a array with many elements
    then lots of memory can be requred and lots of time copying data.
    </li>
    <li>
    The producer must only modify data in a monitorElement between <b>getFree</b> and <b>setUsed</b>.
    This is why the discussion of unionArray and structureArray is important,
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>BitSet and PVStructure</h3>
<p>Some important features of pvAccess are:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>PVAccess Transmits Top Level PVStructures</dt>
    <dd>
     For example a monitor event sends data from server to client as a top
     level PVStructure.
     </dd>
  <dt>Top Level Introspection Immutable</dt>
     <dd>
     Once a top level PVStructure is created it's introspection
     can not be modified.
    Thus pvAccess has no need to send introspection information
    with data. Consider channelGet as an example.
    When a channelGet is created the server creates a top level
    pvStructure for get requests.
    The server sends the introspection info back to the client
    side of pvAccess, which also creates a top level pvStructure.
    Each time the client issues a get request the data is
    copied into the top level pvStructure of the server and
    transmitted to the client side of pvAccess,
    which puts the data in it's top level pvStructure,
    and finally presented to the client.
     </dd>
  <dt>Only fields that change are transmitted.</dt>
    <dd>
      Only the data for fields that change value between requests
      are sent.
     </dd>
  <dt>Clients can request an arbitrary set of fields from server.</dt>
    <dd>
     The client does not have to receive all fields provided by the
     server but can request an arbitrary subset of the fields.
     </dd>
</dl>
<p>In order to implement the above features pvAccess uses bitSets,
where each bit is associated with a field.
The following is a top level pvStructure and how bits from a bitSet
are assigned:</p>
<a name="bitAssignment"></a>
<pre>
bit#    field
0    structure
1        double scalarValue
2        structure timeStamp
3            long secondsPastEpoch
4            int nanoSeconds
5            int userTag
6        union unionValue
             structure timeStamp
                 long secondsPastEpoch
                 int nanoSeconds
                 int userTag
7        structure[] structureValue
             structure timeStamp
                 long secondsPastEpoch
                 int nanoSeconds
                 int userTag
             structure timeStamp
                 long secondsPastEpoch
                 int nanoSeconds
                 int userTag
8        any[] unionValue
             any
                 structure timeStamp
                     long secondsPastEpoch
                     int nanoSeconds
                     int userTag
             any
                 double value
9        string lastValue
</pre>
<p>Note that bits for structure subfields are assigned recursively.
But each scalar, union, scalarArray, structureArray, and unionArray field
are assigned a single bit.
This means that each subfield of a union, structuctureArray, or unionArray
is treated just like a new top level field.
If ANY change is made to a union, scalarArray, structureArray,
or unionArray, the complete set of data for that field is sent.
</p>
<p><b>Comment:</b>
A pvAccess client can ask for a subset of the fields in the pvStructure from  the
PVRecord.
But if a field is a union, unionArray, or structureArray then that entire field must be
selected, i. e. it is not possible to recurse into these field types.
</p>
<h3>Convert and pvCopy</h3>
<h4>pvCopy</h4>

<p>The pvAccess providers use the pvCopy facility to copy data between 
a clients pvStructure and the pvStructure in the PVRecord.
When an instance of PVCopy is created it creates a reference to
the PVStructure in the PVRecord.
It's methods have arguments that include the pvStructure and changedBitSet for the client.
What pvCopy does is look for matching fields in the two pvStructures
and call the Convert facility to copy data between the matching fields.
</p>
<h4>Convert</h4>
<p>Among the methods provided by the convert facility
are methods to copy pvFields with compatible field types.`
This means:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>scalar</dt>
     <dd>
      The scalarTypes must be the same or both must be numeric.
     </dd>
   <dt>scalarArray</dt>
     <dd>
      For C++ the elementTypes must be the same.
      Java also converts between numeric types.
     </dd>
   <dt>structure</dt>
     <dd>
     The introspection interfaces must be equal.
     </dd>
   <dt>union</dt>
     <dd>
     The introspection interfaces must be identical.
     </dd>
   <dt>unionArray</dt>
     <dd>
     The introspection interfaces must be identical.
     </dd>
   <dt>structureArray</dt>
     <dd>
     The introspection interfaces must be identical.
     </dd>
</dl>


<h2>pvDataCPP: Existing Implementation of PVArray</h2>
<p>
For arrays the C++ implementation enforces COW (Copy On Write) semantics.
It implements <b>shared_vector</b>, which is simlar to <b>std::vector</b>
except that is uses <b>std::shared_ptr</b> to hold the raw array.
All PVArray fields use a <b>const shared_vector</b> to hold the raw array.
This means that is is not possible to modify the array element.
Instead to change the raw data a new <b>shared_vector</b> must be created,
converted to a <b>const shared_vector</b>, and then used to replace the original
<b>const shared_vector</b>
</p>
<p>
Convert does deep copies between scalar and structure fields
but shallow copies between union, scalarArray, structureArray, and unionArray fields.
For scalarArray fields this is safe because the implementation of
arrays implements COW (Copy on Write) by making the array data <b>const</b>.
This forces code to create new raw data in order to change a scalar array
field.
It also uses <b>const</b> for structureArray and unionArray fields
but this does not force all elements of the array to be <b>const</b>.
Thus the elements can be changed.
Thus any code that wants to share a top level PVStructure
must be very careful when changing the value of a union,
structureArray, or unionArray field.
The rule is that the union, structureArray, or unionArray
must be replaced with a new value.
</p>
<p>Convert doing a shallow copy
means is that instead of copying each element the
destination pvField shares the same underlying data as the source,
i. e. the two shared pointers
reference the same data,
Thus both memory usage and the time to copy the data is saved.
</p>
<p>Since the pvCopy facility makes extensive use of Convert
the same rules apply to it.</p>
<p><b>Problem:</b>
The fact that convert does a shallow copy for union, unionArray, and structureArray
fields means that code that puts to any of these field types must
create a new instance of the underlying data and than use it to replace
the original underlying data.</p>
<p>Lets take structureArray as an example.
Assume some code gets the interface to the value field.
The code can not change the value array element themselves but it
can modify subfields of the array elements.
For example the following:</p>
<pre>
static void test()
{   
    FieldCreatePtr fieldCreate = getFieldCreate();
    PVDataCreatePtr pvDataCreate = getPVDataCreate();
    StandardFieldPtr standardField = getStandardField();
    StandardPVFieldPtr standardPVField = getStandardPVField();
    ConvertPtr convert = getConvert();
    
    FieldBuilderPtr fieldBuilder = fieldCreate-&gt;createFieldBuilder();
    StructureConstPtr valueStructure = fieldBuilder -&gt;
       add("short",pvShort) -&gt;
       add("long",pvLong) -&gt;
       createStructure();
    PVStructurePtr top = pvDataCreate-&gt;createPVStructure(
       fieldBuilder-&gt;
       addArray("value",valueStructure) -&gt;
       createStructure());
    size_t n = 2;
    PVStructureArray::svector values(n); 
    for(size_t i=0; i&lt;n ; ++i) values[i] = pvDataCreate-&gt;createPVStructure(valueStructure);
    PVStructureArrayPtr pvValue = top-&gt;getSubField&lt;PVStructureArray&gt;("value");
    pvValue-&gt;replace(freeze(values));
    cout &lt;&lt; *top &lt;&lt; endl;
    PVStructureArray::const_svector cvalues(pvValue-&gt;view());
    PVStructurePtr pvSubField = cvalues[0];
    pvSubField-&gt;getSubField&lt;PVShort&gt;("short")-&gt;put(10);
    cout &lt;&lt; *top &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</pre>
produces:
<pre>
structure 
    structure[] value
        structure 
            short short 0
            long long 0
        structure 
            short short 0
            long long 0

structure 
    structure[] value
        structure 
            short short 10
            long long 0
        structure 
            short short 0
            long long 0
</pre>
Look at the last three lines of the sample code.
Note that the value of the short field of the first structure element
changed value even though
cvalues is a constant shared vector.

<h2>pvDataJava: Existing Implementation of PVArray</h2>
<p>
pvDataJava does a deep copy of all fields 
with the possible exception of scalar array fields.
If the source and destination have the same scalarType
and the source is immutable then the raw data array is shared
and the destination is made immutable.
</p>
<h2>pvDataCPP: Issues</h2>
<p>The following discuses a number of array related issues.
Some of the ideas may conflict with other ideas.
</p>
<h3>PVUnion</h3>
<p>Should convert do a deep copy instead of a shallow copy?</p>
<p>After all a union has at most a single subfield.
The cost of a deep copy depends on the complexity of the subfield
and whether or not it changes type.
If it does not change type no new memory needs to be created.
This is a strong argument for deep copy.
</p>
<h3>PVUnionArray and PVStructureArray</h3>
<h4>Possible Changes To Convert</h4>
<p>
Perhaps convert should allow the caller to specify
if shallow or deep copies are desired.
A posibility is to add deepCopy to the  following methods:</p>
<pre>
class Convert 
{
...
    void copy(
        PVFieldPtr const &amp; from,
        PVFieldPtr const &amp; to,
        bool deepCopy = false);
    void copyStructure(
        PVStructurePtr const &amp; from,
        PVStructurePtr const &amp; to,
        bool deepCopy = false);
    void copyStructureArray(
        PVStructureArrayPtr const &amp; from,
        PVStructureArrayPtr const &amp; to,
        bool deepCopy = false);
    void copyUnion(
        PVUnionPtr const &amp; from,
        PVUnionPtr const &amp; to,
        bool deepCopy = false);
    void copyUnionArray(
        PVUnionArrayPtr const &amp; from,
        PVUnionArrayPtr const &amp; to,
        bool deepCopy = false);
}
</pre>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> If some combination of the ideas in the next three sections are
adapted then there should be enough information  for convert to know when
it should do a shallow or a deep copy.
<p>
<h4>Make PVStructureArray and PVUnionArray immutable</h4>
<p>When a producer puts data into a PVStructureArray or PVUnionArray
can we develop a way to make not just the array but all elements
and all fields in each element immuttable?
</p>
<p>
One way is to call setImmutable on the PVStructureArray or PVUnionArray.
Then the only way to change anything is to call the replace method.
</p>
<p>Is to possible to have all fields under a PVStructureArray or PVUnionArray
be dynamically changed to be <b>const</b>?
</p>
<p>
If it is how expensive is it?
</p>
<h4>Allow all arrays to be mutable or immutable.</h4>
<p>This means PVScalarArray, PVStructureArray, and PVUnionArray.
<b>shared_vector</b> would still be used to hold the raw array
but it would not be forced to be a <b>const shared_vector</b>.
</p>
<p>An argument in favor is a top level PVStructure, which has an array subfield,
being passed through a processing chain and each member of the chain modifies the
array data.</p>
<p>How hard is this to implement?
It it worthwhile?
</p>
<h3>Possible Bugs</h3>
<h4>method replace</h4>
<p>Currently this is implemented by DefaultPVArray, PVStructureArray, and PVUnionArray.
Each has the code:</p>
<pre>
        checkLength(other.size());
        value = other;
        PVField::postPut();
</pre>
<p>Each should be changed to also check for type compatibilitty.
Thus:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
      DefaultPVArray should check that introspection interfaces are identical.
  </li>
  <li>
    PVStructureArray should also check that element introspection interfaces are identical.
  </li>
  <li>
    PVUnionArray should also check that element introspection interfaces are identical.
  </li>
</ul>
<p
>While doing this other methods that modify any PVArray should be checked for similar problems.
</p>

<h4>setImmutable</h4>
<p>This has problems. The following:</p>
<pre>
static void tesyModify(const PVStructurePtr & pvStructure)
{
   PVDoublePtr pvDouble = pvStructure-&gt;getSubField&lt;PVDouble&gt;("value");
   pvDouble-&gt;put(10.0);
}

static void test()
{
    StandardPVFieldPtr standardPVField = getStandardPVField();

    PVStructurePtr doubleRecord = standardPVField-&gt;scalar(pvDouble,"");
    doubleRecord-&gt;getSubField("value")-&gt;setImmutable();
    cout&lt;&lt; *doubleRecord &lt;&lt; endl;
    tesyModify(doubleRecord);
    cout&lt;&lt; *doubleRecord &lt;&lt; endl;
}

int main(int argc,char *argv[])
{
    test();
    return 0;
}
</pre>
Produces:
<pre>
epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0 
    double value 0

epics:nt/NTScalar:1.0 
    double value 10
</pre>
<p>Thus even though a scala field is immutable it was modified.
Both the implementation of PVData and Convery need to be looked at carefully so that
they enforce immutability.
</p>
<h2>pvDataJava: Issues</h2>
<p>The shareData method has never been properly tested.
Also it should have the same semantics as pvDataCPP.
If shareData is requested then after the shallow copy the field must be
make immutable.
Note that immutable can substitute for <b>const shared_vector</b>.
