<p>EPICS base version 3.14 is required to run Version 4. </p>
<p>Major new features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dynamic channel data typing, by unions</li>

<li>More flexible and informative channel data API [channel* callbacks]</li>
<li>Codec based transport, plus bundled codecs for pvAccess and ZeroMQ</li>
<li>Multicast support</li>
<li>Pluggable pvAccess security API</li>
<li>Smart handling of data measurement and fitting errors [Normative type errors]</li>
<li>Composite IOC PV data [dbGroup]</li>
<li>Simplified and upgraded eget command line tool [unified pvget/eget]</li>
<li>Upgraded Easy to use API [easyPVA]</li>
</ul>
<p>Cleanups and infrastructue changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Reimplemented pvCopy</li>
</ul>
<p>Alpha software bundled</p>
<ul>
<li>An embeddable smart database and processing framework for the IOC [pvDatabase]</li>
<li>Monitor processing options</li>
</ul>
<p>A more  detailed description of the changes to the V4 core modules pvAccess and
pvData w.r.t. release 4.4, is given in
<a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/internal/proposedChanges/proposedChanges_3_0.html">proposedChanges_3_0.html</a></p>
<h2>High performance and simplified array handling [pvArray, COW]</h2>
<p>The C++ implementation of the data management interface of EPICS V4, pvData,
now enforces Copy On Write (COW) semantics, to reduce
computationaly expensive copy operations to the absolute minimum. </p>
<p>The API for extracting array data and type conversion, <code>Convert</code> has been
greatly simplified. </p>
<p>The method for put and get array data to a channel, <code>channelArray</code> has been upgraded.</p>
<h2>Dynamic data typing</h2>
<p>A new basic data type has been added for expressing unions. PV data may now dynamically change type.</p>
<p>A union is like a structure that has a single sub-field with
a type that can be changed dynamically. There are two subtypes of union:</p>
<ul>
<li>variant union, in which the type can be any type</li>
<li>a "regular" union, in which the type must be one of the fixed set of types, determined by the introspection interface of a given union instance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>More flexible and informative channel data API  [channel* callbacks]</h2>
<p>pvAccess channelGet, channelPut, channelPutGet, and monitor have been upgarded to
provide connection callbacks with introspection interfaces to the data and its bitset metadata.</p>
<p>The PVData data and bitsets are now arguments given by the component that provided the data,
so a client can examine what data it has been returned by the provider.</p>
<h2>Codec based pvAccess implementation</h2>
<p>Using a codec decouples protocol from transport. All the protocol [GW: do you
mean "protocol", or do you mean "transport" here? - I think you mean transport]
specific code is now encapluslated in one abstract class. Transport specific
code (as provided by for instance TCP, UDP, shared memory, or zeroMQ) must
then be provided in order to get a fully functional pvAccess communication.</p>
<p>Codecs for the former transport layer of pvAccess, and ZeroMQ transport, are provided,
so you can use pvAccess or ZeroMQ immediately.</p>
<h2>Multicast support</h2>
<p>Implementation of multicast used for channel/service discovery and shared data transfer, is added to pvAccess.</p>
<h2>Pluggable pvAccess security API</h2>
<p>A security plugin API is added, that allows pluggable
implementation of specific security schemes.</p>
<h2>Smart handling of data measurement and fitting errors [Normative type errors]</h2>
<p>The system of high level data types, called Normative Types
(<a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes.html">http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes.html</a>)
have been revised and extended to properly incorporate errors on data values. Clients and intelligent OPIs can now find and display the measurement or fit error along with the data of a PV.</p>
<h2>Composite IOC PV data [dbGroup]</h2>
<p>The IOC can now return the value of a number of records as a single PV's value. For instance, a single IOC hosted PV may give both the magnetic field strength and setpoint current of a magnet.</p>
<p>Although the PVs comprising the returned PV's value, need not be from the same lockset, the data from them is not lockset atomic. When the IOC base software incorporates atomic lockset spaning operations, this function will be upgraded.</p>
<h2>Simplified and upgraded eget command line tool [unified pvget/eget]</h2>
<p>eget and pvget have been unified into one comprehensive command, doing all the functions of get, monitor, and rpc, over PVA, or CA (if CA supports the operation), and supporting pvaRequest and URL syntax.</p>
<h2>Upgraded Easy to use API [easyPVA]</h2>
<p>The easy to use API, easyPVA <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/easyPVAJava/tip/documentation/easyPVA.html">http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/easyPVAJava/tip/documentation/easyPVA.html</a> is upgraded to include monitors and parallel acqusitions (multichannel).</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>Non-functional changes and cleanups</h1>
<h2>Reimplemented pvCopy</h2>
<p><code>pvCopy</code>, which used together with <code>pvRequest</code>, allows a client to access to an arbitrary subset
of the data in the structure associated with a pvAccess channel, has been moved from its two implementations in pvIOCJava and pvDatabaseCPP, to a single implementation in <code>pvData</code>, and its dependency on pvRecord has been removed.</p>
<p>Additionally, <code>CreateRequest</code>, which is used by clients to create a pvRequest,
has been moved from pvAccess to pvData.</p>
<p>Uses of <code>pvCopy</code> in <code>pvIOCJava</code> and <code>pvDatabaseCPP</code> have been
changed to use the <code>pvCopy</code> from pvData.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<h1>Alpha software bundled</h1>
<p>Some powerful but alpha level software is also bundled into V4.4 for early adopters.</p>
<h2>An embedded smart database and processing framework for the IOC [pvDatabase]</h2>
<p>Version 4.4 provides a framework for implementing a network accessible database of smart memory resident records, named pvDatabase. Such a database may be embedded into an IOC to work in concert with the IOC's database, or at higher levels of a control system to provide high performance dataflow processing of lower level measurement data. For instance, it can be used to host a set of areaDetector plugins, working as a pipeline processor for camera image data. See pvDatabaseCPP <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDatabaseCPP/tip/documentation/pvDatabaseCPP.html">http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvDatabaseCPP/tip/documentation/pvDatabaseCPP.html</a>.</p>
<h2>Monitor processing options</h2>
<p>This is only in pvdataCPP.
It is a way for a client to specify processing options for monitors.</p>
