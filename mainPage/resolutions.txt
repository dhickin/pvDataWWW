RESOLUTIONS of the EPICS v4 Working Group
=========================================

===============================
7-Sep-2011 telecon: http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/meeting_07092011.txt

1. PVManager shall be in scope. 

2. A Directory Service is in scope. This is likely to be based on
ChannelFinder.

3. Archive service shall be in scope.

4.  Gather service will not be in scope for now. It may be put in
scope after a review.

5. PVioc c++ for controls is in scope, but not high priority. Present
work on completing pvIOCCPP specifically for use in a V3 IOC to act as
a pvAccess server endpoint, should be completed before putting this
work aside though.  

6. Work on pvget work should be divided into two priority steps. Short
term, iron out connection and just produce Strings from whatever you
get. Longer term, figure out type, and return and actually useful
type.
