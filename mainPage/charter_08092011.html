<h2 id="process">Basis for Work</h2>

<p>The EPICS v4 working group is supported by Brookhaven Lab (BNL) and
collaborating organizations, subject to their following this Charter.
</p>

<h2 id="mission">Mission</h2>

<p>The main objective of the EPICS v4 Working Group
(<abbr title="EPICS v4 Working Group">EPICS v4</abbr>) is to specify, publish and implement, a
core network messaging system, data format, and client and server APIs,
that enable development of efficient distributed control and
application services for large scientific instruments and industrial
plants.  A second objective is development of a core set of associated
software tools and frameworks that use the data exchange system for
productive development of host level services and interactive
applications.
</p>

<h2 id="scope">Scope and Goals</h2>

<p>EPICS version 3 and its predecessors have been enormously
successful as a framework for distributed device control, but have not
been optimal for all purposes. Firstly, the underlying network
protocol has not been documented and standardized, and so is not
suitable for independent implementation or extension. Secondly, the
network codec and message passing system has not supported passing
semi-structured data, nor arguments, and so not been suitable for
use as a services layer in support of host level scientific
applications. </p>

<p>The EPICSv4 Working Group is chartered to define and publish an open control
protocol for control system endpoints, which functionally extends
channel access to suitability for both device control and high level
services. This must include data types suitable for high level
services, including at least a heterogeneous table (as might be
used for returning results from a relational database query) and
"multi-channel" array. It should also include a dynamically run-time
constructed heterogeneous type analogous to CORBA's Any type
or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/">XMLHTTPRequest</a>
object (the basis of Web Services).
</p>

<p>Specifically, the EPICSv4 group is chartered to procedure a
standard for the interface of user level clients, for updating
displays, control, and application level data, to services and device
control implemented in an
<a href="#EPICSv4IOC">EPICS v4 IOC</a>, or in an EPICS v3 IOC (where a
client may itself be an EPICS v4 IOC).</p>

<p>Java, C or C++, bindings must be supplied for all implementations
of each normative standard. 
</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

    <p><strong>The goals of the Working Group are:</strong></p> 
    
<ol>

  <li id="go:pvaccess">Production of an open, documented, control
    system message protocol suitable for device control and services
    in a distributed control system; including support for
    semi-structured type transport (see below) and parametrized
    (attribute=value) PV value requests. This is known as
    pvAccess </li>

  <li id="go:pvdata">Production of an open, documented, data type
    encoder/decoder capable of exchanging both atomic and
    semi-structured data with high performance, suitable as the data
    exchange format for services. This is known as pvData</li>

  <li id="g:pvioc">Production of an Input/Output Controller (IOC)
    framework, suitable for both controls and services, that is on the
    back-end compatible with EPICS v3 record processing, and on the
    front-end with the message and data protocols described
    above. This is known as pvIOC [TBD. This goal needs to be made
    clearer. We may well remove the goal the it includes control
    altogether, and descope control in pvIOC.]</li>

  <li id="go:services">Production of a software framework for
    scientific services, as will be suitable for online optimization
    (e.g. modelling) or coordinated device control (e.g. energy
    management of a whole linac, or beam synchronized BPM orbit
    acquisition)</li>
 
  <li id="go:interopv3">Interoperability with EPICS v3. The pvAccess
    message protocol must be interoperable with EPICS
    v3.14. See <a href="#interopv3">Interoperability with EPICS v3
    below</a></li>

  <li id="go:interopv4">Interoperability of EPICS v4 clients
    and <em>EPICS v4 services</em>. Any general purpose client, such
    as a command line "pvget" tool, must be able to acquire any data
    served by any EPICS v4
    service. See <a href="#interoppv4">Interoperability within EPICS
    v4</a> below</li>

  <li id="go:perf">High Performance. The above protocols and
    controller framework must be of high
    performance. See <a href="#go:perfgoals">Performance goals</a>
    below
  </li>

  <li id="go:adopt">Exceptionally easy adoptability. The above
    protocols and framework must be transparent, documented, and
    delivered so that it is very easy for a developer to create EPICS
    v4 IOC applications and services</li>

  <li id="go:impl">Implementability. The above protocols, and the
    processing of message I/O, must be documented in such as way that
    outside software developers can easily create an interoperable
    implementation</li>

  <li id="go:err">Error handling. All normative software
    implementations must handle and log all errors in such a way that
    distributed users can see both the causes and outcomes of all
    errors. In practice, this will mean the creation and adoption of a
    single error messaging standard, perhaps an EPICS v4 service whose
    job it is to receive and log errors from all other endpoints.</li>

</ol>


<h3 id="interopv3">Interoperability with EPICS v3</h3>
<p>EPICS v4 clients must be interoperable with EPICS v3
IOCs. Specifically, PvAccess must run in version 3 IOCs and serve all
v3 type structures.</p>

<p>This mechanism must satisfy the expected use case of device control
including EPICS v4 in the medium term; in which device control will
continue to be through EPICS v3, with control wire protocols and
client sides in EPICS v4. It is expected that in the longer term, past the
duration of this charter, the EPICS v4 IOC will be properly extended
into device control.</p>

<p>The extent and any limitations of compatibility with adjacent
layers in the EPICS v3 protocol stack must be documented as
a <a href="#normative">normative document</a> of the working group.
</p>

<h3 id="interopv4">Interoperability within EPICS v4</h3>
<p>Each normative standard must be demonstrated to be interoperable
with adjacent layers in the EPICS v4 protocol stack by production of,
and testing, at least one implementation.</p>

<h3 id="perfgoals">Performance Goals</h3>
<p>The following minimum performance goals are expected:</p>

<ul>
  <li>put &#47; get - 80% if channel access</li>
  <li>monitors - 80% of channel access</li>
  <li>multicast - each point is 80% but it is more scalable</li>
  <li>streams (bulk data) - 80% of the capability of the media.  For
    example, over 10GBit Ethernet, then 8GBits of data transfer on a
    dedicated VLAN. This should be optimized for sending images and
    multidimensional arrays, and by implication should minimize
    copying.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="out">Out of Scope</h2>

<p>The following are out of scope for the group specifically: </p> 

<ol> 

  <li>Both and only Java and C/C++ bindings are required for reference
  implementations of the core protocols (pvAccess and pvData). One one
  or the other language binding is required for service
  implementations</li>

  <li>Operating System implementations. [TBD: Which architecture and
  OSes should be in scope for clients, services (EPICS4 IOCs
  implementing "RPC" services), and EPICS v4 IOCs? I think Windows
  reference implementations should be specifically out of scope] </li>

  <li>Development of application specific data protocols or IOC
  processes, are out of scope. Like channel access itself, the new
  data protocol and IOC must support a wide variety of applications,
  and the group should not spend time optimizing for any given
  service. For instance, inclusion of specific type designs for
  archiving, images, scanning, are out of scope. Rather, it's expected
  that the <a href="#interopdatatypes">EPICS v4 Interoperable
  Types</a> specification, will define one or two general purpose
  types that can be used for semi-structured data, and include a
  dynamic type that can be used to construct highly application
  specific types. A few reference application specific data types may
  be published, but they are only for illustration and offered as a
  basis for extensions. </li>

  <li>Development of specific production quality services are out of
  scope. A few reference services may be produced, but they are only
  for illustration and offered as a basis for extensions.</li>

</ol>

<p>With respect to development of support for specific services in
  the core protocols, or development of specific services, being out of scope:
  any user, including a member of EPICS v4, is free to use the
  products of the EPICS v4 group to develop controls, extend any
  protocol, or create production services, but the group itself should
  concentrate on the normative standards and their implementations. A
  separate group may choose to produce some production interoperable
  services and applications, but they are out of scope for EPICS
  v4.</p>

<h2 id="success">Success Criteria</h2>

<p>Derived from the goals above, success criteria are at least:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Adoption or planned adoption of EPICS v4 in the EPICS
 community</li>
 <li>Demonstrated interoperability of EPICS v4 clients and EPICS v4
 services</li>
 <li>Demonstrated interoperability with EPICS v3</li>
 <li>Demonstrated high performance</li>
 <li>Demonstrated easy to implement an EPICS v4 service, taking
 arguments, and returning semi-structured data</li>
 <li>Easy for a developer to acquire, understand, and build, a
 reference implementation of pvAccess and pvData (independently of
 their server side housing in an EPICS v4 IOC)</li>
 <li>Easy for a developer to acquire, understand, build and deploy, a
 reference implementation of EPICS v4 Java IOC or C/C++ IOC. </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="deliverables">Deliverables and Duration</h2>

<p>The outputs of the working group will be delivered as a system of
documented standards, plus reference implementation source code where
relevant. These documents and source codes will all be available from
the EPICS v4 web
site, <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net">http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/</a>. </p>

<h3 class="sub" id="Deliverables">Deliverables</h3>

<p>The group is expected to produce the following normative deliverables:</p>
<ol>
  <li id="de:pvaccess_doc">A normative document of the pvAccess protocol</li>
  <li id="de:pvdata_doc">A normative document of the pvData protocol. The document must
    include the user API - how a programmer creates data objects for the
    wire, and extracts them on the other side</li>
  <li id="de:iocpipe_doc">A normative document of the EPICS v4 IOC processing pipeline</li>
  <li id="de:pvaccess_impl">A reference implementation of pvAccess in each of C++ and Java language bindings</li>
  <li id="de:pvdata_impl">A reference implementation of pvData in each of C++ and Java language bindings</li>
  <li id="de:pvioc_impl">A reference implementation of the EPICS v4 IOC in each of C++ and
    Java language bindings. The Java version has high priority.</li>
  <li id="de:interopdatatypes">A normative document of the EPICS v4
    interoperable data types. These data types must be universally
    understood by every client and service which claims EPICS v4
    compatibility. The requirement for this deliverable is distinct from
    the pvData document deliverable, since pvData can encode any type,
    this deliverable recommends the confined set of data objects that will
    be used by EPICS v4 interoperable services</li>
  <li id="de:servicesAPI">A normative document of the EPICS v4 services
    API. This defines the form for encoding parameters and status
    descriptions between clients and services and back</li>
  <li id="de:interop_doc">A report of interoperability of the EPICS v4 IOC with EPICS v3
    record processing</li>
  <li id="de:perf_doc">A performance report, comparing EPICS v3 to
    EPICS v4 for some common EPICS v3 control and read tasks, plus
    report of the expected performance of EPICS v4 service
    support. For instance, round trip time for network
    encoding/deserialization of results of 4 or 5 common service
    queries such as archive data, orbit data, whole beamline model
    etc</li>
  <li id="de:getstarted_doc">A "Getting Started" document for EPICS v4 Service developers</li>
  <li id="de:iocdev_doc">A User Guide for EPICS v4 IOC control application developers</li>
  <li id="de:protocoldev_doc">A Programmers Guide for EPICS v4 protocol implementers (for
    developing implementations of pvAccess, pvData or pvIOC)</li>
  <li id="commandline_impl">A command line tool similar to caget (call
    it say pvget), which understands all
    the <a href="#interopdatatypes">interoperable data types</a>
    above, and conforms to the <a href="#servicesAPI">EPICS v4
      services API</a> above.</li>
  <li id="de:dirservice_doc">A normative document of the EPICS v4
    Directory Service function, API, and unix command line tool.</li>
  <li id="de:dirservice_impl">A reference implementation of the EPICS
  v4 Directory Service.</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, the group is expected to produce the following
"extensions" of EPICS v4, as non-normative deliverables (as decided in
meeting of <a href="minutes_07092011.txt">meeting of
7-Sep-2011</a>):</p>

<ol start="17">
  <li id="de:pvmanager"><a href="http://pvmanager.sourceforge.net/">pvManager</a>, a
    framework and client side application software library for
    managing sets of EPICS v4 PV acquisitions. </li>
  <li id="de:archive_service">An archive data retrieval service. [TBD: A new architecture for
    archive storage, or just the pvAccess server endpoint that serves
    archive data?]</li>
  <li></li>
</ol>

<h3 class="sub" id="Duration">Duration</h3>

<p>The expiration date of this charter is 1-Sep-2012. At that time,
the group may seek to recharter with BNL and PSI, or determine that
EPICSv4 should be discontinued. </p>
