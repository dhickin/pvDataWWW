<h2 class="nocount">Abstract</h2>

<p>This is an EPICS v4 working group internal document giving the policies and
procedures for releasing numbered versions of EPICS v4 software modules. It also
contains a check-list for use by the Release Coordinator during the process of
creating a new version of the software.</p>

<div id="toc">
<h2 class="nocount" style="page-break-before: always">Table of Contents</h2>

<div id="contents" class="contents">

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document defines the policies that apply to the release of all EPICS v4
software modules released by the EPICS v4 Working Group, and the procedures that
are to be followed when creating official releases of those modules.</p>

<h3>Applicability</h3>

<p>The policies described here have been developed for <span class="ed">and
agreed by</span> the EPICS v4 Working Group, and apply to all core software
modules developed for and formally published by the group.</p>

<p>The procedures documented here SHOULD be followed anyone involved in making
officially numbered releases of the EPICS v4 software modules.</p>


<h2>Release Numbering</h2>

<p>All core EPICS v4 modules are currently being released with the same version
number at approximately the same time. The mercurial repositories of individual
modules should be tagged with the appropriate version number at the time of
release.</p>

<p>The group may also publish non-core software modules such as the pvaSrv
module and various example programs. These are not required to match the common
version number of the core software, but should still follow the numbering
format and policies given below.</p>


<h3>Version numbers</h3>

<pre>4.<i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>bugfix</i>-<i>suffix</i></pre>

<ul>
<li>The first number will always be 4.</li>

<li>The second number <code><i>major</i></code> increments at every major
release.</li>

<li>The third number <code><i>minor</i></code> increments at every minor
release, and is reset to zero whenever the major number changes.</li>

<li>The fourth number <code><i>bugfix</i></code> increments at every bug-fix
release, and is reset to zero whenever the minor number changes.</li>

<!-- &#8209; is a non-breaking hyphen; not needed inside a <pre> block -->
<li>The <code>&#8209;<i>suffix</i></code> (with its leading hyphen character) is
never present in a final official release version number.<br />

In between official releases, the <code>&#8209;<i>suffix</i></code> indicates
the status of the code and is one of <code>&#8209;dev</code> (development),
<code>&#8209;pre<i>n</i></code> (numbered pre-release) or
<code>&#8209;rc<i>n</i></code> (numbered release-candidate).</li>

</ul>

<p>When printing or typing a particular version number, all numeric parts (and
the suffix if relevant) MUST be used/displayed. <span class="ed">This does look
a bit wierd for the version number 4.3.0.0 although apparently the policy was
agreed at a WG meeting. Personally I would be in favor of dropping the
<code>.<i>bugfix</i></code> part when that number is zero. &ndash; AJ</span></p>

<p>The suffix <code>&#8209;BETA</code> that was included with some previous
release version numbers is confusing and will not be used in the future.</p>


<h3>Mercurial version tags</h3>

<p>The leading 4 in the official version numbering is not present in the tags
created in module mercurial repositories. Global version number tags in
mercurial repositories should appear as follows:</p>

<pre><i>major</i>.<i>minor</i>.<i>bugfix</i>-<i>suffix</i></pre>

<p class="ed">See also my comment above about dropping the
<code>.<i>bugfix</i></code> part when that number is zero. &ndash; AJ</p>

<p>Tags should be created in the above format to mark each of the numbered
pre-release and release-candidate versions of each module, and to mark the final
official release (with no <code>&#8209;<i>suffix</i></code>).</p>


<h2>Release Compatibility Policies</h2>

<p>There are two kinds of software compatibility, at the source-code level (API)
and the binary level (ABI). EPICS v4 releases will provide the following
compatibility promises across release boundaries:</p>

<h3>Major releases</h3>

<p>Neither ABI nor API compatibilty is promised through a major release.</p>

<p>Developers SHOULD list and describe all public API changes that have occurred
since the last major release in the Release Notes for the module, and MUST
provide full documentation for the new API (usually using Doxygen or JavaDoc).
If an API change requires significant changes to code that calls that API, an
example showing both before and after code should be provided in or linked from
the Release Notes. Code using the older API SHOULD NOT successfully compile
against the new API if it will not run properly without modification.</p>

<h3>Minor releases</h3>

<p>Forward API compatibility is promised through a minor release but not ABI
compatibilty, meaning that software written against the old version MUST compile
and run against the new one without changes; the recompilation step is required
though. Backward API compatibility is not promised, but where there have not
been any API changes an application written for a newer release SHOULD compile
and run successfully against an earlier minor release version.</p>

<p>Developers MUST consider these compatibility requirements during minor
release development. Tests SHOULD be written to check forward API compatibility
for all modules where public API changes are being made, ensuring that the older
methods and routines remain fully functional in the modified implementation.</p>

<h3>Bug-fix releases</h3>

<p>Other than changes required by the bug fix, both forward and backward
compatibility MUST be provided for both the API and ABI through a bugfix
release. For architectures that use shared libraries, it should only be
necessary to replace the original shared libraries with the new ones, without
recompiling any application that uses them. For architectures that statically
link libraries into binary executables the link step will have to be re-run,
although in this case it may be better to just rebuild the application
completely.</p>

<p>Developers MUST consider these compatibility requirements while fixing bugs,
and MUST NOT make any modifications to the names, call signatures or semantics
of public API routines or methods unless those changes are needed to bring the
implementation into line with the originally-published specification. If a bug
cannot be fixed without making such a change, the fix requires a new minor
release instead of a bug-fix release.</p>

<p class="caption">Note: EPICS v4 developers do not have much experience of
promising ABI compatibility. This policy may change after reviewing this
experience for a time.</p>


<h2>Release Process</h2>

<h3>Roles and responsibilities</h3>

<p>The following roles are used in the release process described below.
Individuals may take multiple roles as necessary.</p>

<ul>
<li>Release Coordinator (RC) &ndash; a project manager for the release</li>
<li>Module Owner (MO) &ndash; the proprietor of a one-person module</li>
<li>Module Developers (MD) &ndash; everyone who works on the code</li>
<li>Module Packagers (MP) &ndash; the individuals who make tar/jar files</li>
<li>Website Editor (WE) &ndash; the publicist and website manager</li>
</ul>

<h3>Release stages</h3>

<p>Software releases of operation-ready modules will go through all the stages
below. Software that is still undergoing development may skip the release
candidate stage and take a more liberal view of bug severity when taking the
final release decision.</p>

<h4>Release decision</h4>

<p>The working group or a designated Module Owner decides that a new version of
the software is to be released, what changes it should contain, and whether this
is to be a major, minor or bug-fix release. The release version number is
agreed, and a Release Coordinator is nominated to manage the release process
(where the software to be released has a single Module Owner they would normally
be expected to take on the role of the Release Coordinator). The dates for
feature freeze and/or the final release may be discussed, but the process of
finding and fixing bugs can easily thwart a specific final release deadline.</p>

<h4>Release planning</h4>

<p>The Release Coordinator studies the process and procedures described in this
document, then proposes any changes desired to the working group for agreement.
In conjunction with the Module Developers responsible for the software being
released, the Release Coordinator will develop and publish a timetable for the
remaining stages in the process.</p>

<p>Module Developers should look for any remaining bugs that can/should be fixed
in this release, and provide feedback to the Release Coordinator about the
release timetable.</p>

<h4>Feature freeze</h4>

<p>All development work on new features for this relese must have been completed
by this date; incomplete features should have been backed out and no additional
feature branches should be merged afterwards. Only bug fixes and documentation
updates should be committed during the following period (normally 2 weeks but
this may vary) until the first pre-release.</p>

<p>Module Developers are expected to complete the documentation and test the
software to identify and fix any major bugs before the software gets published
to a wider audience.</p>

<h4>Pre-releases</h4>

<p>These are tagged, built and/or packaged versions of the code created by the
Module Packager(s) that the Website Editor publishes as such for testing by the
wider EPICS developer community. The first pre-release version has the suffix
<code>&#8209;pre1</code> and subsequent pre-releases if any should be numbered
sequentially. Each pre-release version is normally left open for 2 weeks, and
any significant bugs discovered in this time can result in an additional
pre-release version being created after the bugs have been fixed.</p>

<p>Module Developers should try to test the software in unusual configurations
and on less common platforms during this period, and should also read through
and fix errors and omissions in the documentation.</p>

<h4>Release candidates</h4>

<p>Once the group believes the software to be free of major bugs and fully
documented, the Release Coordinator nominates the next version to be a release
candidate, the first of which is given the suffix <code>&#8209;rc1</code>. All
release candidate versions are publicized to the wider EPICS user community for
testing, and will normally be left open for 2 weeks.</p>

<p>If significant bugs are discovered they must be fixed, and the Module
Developers and Release Coordinator may then agree to publish another release
candidate version with those fixes, or may revert to a pre-release version to
ensure the bugs have been properly fixed.</p>

<h4>Final release</h4>

<p>Some time (usually 2 weeks) after a release candidate has been published with
no major bug reports for it in that period, the final release version will be
created and published. Minor bugs that have not been fixed should be documented
in a list of Known Problems that accompanies the release.</p>

<h2>Packaging Instructions</h2>

<p class="ed">Note: I have not checked or corrected these instructions or their
associated scripts &ndash; AJ</p>

<p>Release steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tag Mercurial repositories (currently pvData, pvAccess, pvIOC, pvService)</li>
<li>Clone tagged repositories to a build server (your local machine or Jenkins)</li>
<li>Generate release documentation and upload to sourceforge web area</li>
<li>Create release archives and upload to sourceforge file area</li>
</ol>

<p>Release scripts are in mercurial under <a
href="http://epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/epics-pvdata/pvDataWWW/file/tip/scripts">pvDataWWW/scripts</a>.
</p>

<p>During the release process documentation (both written and generated) is copied from the <code>documentation</code> directory in each repository to <code>epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/$REPO/$TAGNAME/documentation</code>.
</p>

<h3>Packaging C++ Modules</h3>

<p>Several scripts are provided to automate the packaging process, which must be
edited to set the correct tag and user-name for the release.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Code:</dt>
  <dd><a href="http://epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/epics-pvdata/pvDataWWW/file/tip/scripts/tagtip.sh">tagtip.sh</a>
  &ndash; clones the repositories, tags the current head, then pushes the
  changes back to SF.</dd>

  <dd><a href="http://epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/epics-pvdata/pvDataWWW/file/tip/scripts/makerelease.sh">makerelease.sh</a>
  &ndash; clones the tagged repositories, uses <code>hg archive</code> to
  combine the results into a new directory tree, adds the RELEASE.local file and
  a generated tag.txt file, generates a tar.gz file, then copies that to the
  file area.</dd>

  <dt>Documentation:</dt>
  <dd><a href="http://epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/epics-pvdata/pvDataWWW/file/tip/scripts/syncdoxygen.sh">syncdoxygen.sh</a>
  &ndash; clones the tagged repositories, adds a copy of RELEASE.local and
  CONFIG_SITE.local to each, compiles each module and runs doxygen, then copies
  the generated documentation directories to the web area.</dd>

</dl>

<h3>Packaging Java Modules</h3>

<p class="ed">This text needs updating to the new version numbering above
&ndash; AJ</p>

<dl>
<dt>Code:</dt>

<dd>
<p>To make a versioned release of EPICS V4 core modules Java implementation:</p>
<p>Recall the build dependencies of the EPICS v4 core modules are:</p>
<ul>
<li>pvDataJava has no dependencies</li>
<li>pvAccessJava depends on pvDataJava</li>
<li>pvIOCJava depends on pvAaccessJava and pvDataJava for build</li>
<li>exampleJava depends on all 4 above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit each of the 5 pom.xml files 
pvIOCJava, pvAaccessJava and pvDataJava, pvServiceJava plus exampleJava, to change the version name.
Our naming convention is n.m-BETA (note caps) to designate a
BETA release, or later simply n.m. Intermediate snaphots are named
n.m-SNAPSHOT. Therefore, the first Beta is named 1.0-BETA:</p>
<pre>
Clone the repo, eg:

hg clone ssh://gregorywhite@epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvDataJava

To tag and build for Java/Maven:

In pom.xml you have

<version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>

change to eg 1.0-BETA in top <version></version> and also in the dependencies, so you
build like versions against each other, starting with pvDataJava (that has no dependencies).

<version>1.0-BETA</version>
</pre>

<p>Build locally to test build and test suite.</p>
<pre>
% pwd
/Users/greg/Development/epicsV4/ev4hg

% cd pvDataJava
% mvn compile install

% cd ../pvAccessJava
% mvn compile install -Dmaven.test.skip=true

% cd ../pvIOCJava
% mvn compile install -DJAVAIOC=$PWD -Dmaven.test.skip=true

% cd ../exampleJava/
% mvn compile install 
</pre>
<p>Verify you got what you expected, you want the 3 core modules plus exampleJavas' jars:</p>
<pre>
% find ~/.m2 -name "pv*BETA.jar" -o -name "example*BETA.jar"
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/exampleJava/1.0-BETA/exampleJava-1.0-BETA.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/pvAccess/1.0-BETA/pvAccess-1.0-BETA.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/pvData/1.0-BETA/pvData-1.0-BETA.jar
/Users/greg/.m2/repository/epics/pvIOC/1.0-BETA/pvIOC-1.0-BETA.jar
</pre>

<p>Upload the release. In each of the 4 directories, commit the pom.xml, tag the
repo, and push.</p>
<pre>
hg commit -m "beta 1 version inc" pom.xml

Then tag:

hg tag 1.0-BETA

and push:

hg push
</pre>

<p>This results in remote repository that is version tagged.
Now Jenkins will build 1.0-BETA version and deploy JARs in EPICS 4 remote maven
products directory (see below).

Before making any changes to the project (the best thing is to do it
immediately) you need to increase version to 1.1-SNAPSHOT. This way new changes will
not override the deployed 1.0-BETA. However, hold on a second Tex, it's a good idea
to versify that Jenkins has built and deployed the 1.0-BETA release jar file, before
pushing this new version, since this one will also result in a build and
deployment. Check the Maven build products directory <a
href="http://epics.sourceforge.net/maven2/epics/">http://epics.sourceforge.net/maven2/epics/</a>,
then:
</p>
<p>So, again in each of the 4 directories above, edit pom.xml and hg commit and push:</p>
<pre>
&lt;version&gt;1.1-SNAPSHOT&lt;/version&gt;

and

hg commit pom.xml
hg push
</pre>

<h4>Create the Source User downloadable tarball</h4>

<p>The download tarball is what we put in the SourceForge download files area, and
includes all the EPICS V4 jars just created, plus
associated source, XMLs, scripts etc needed by someone to get going. 
</p>

<p>The tarball includes the README file, so before creating it, edit
pvDataWWW/mainPage/README with details of the release, commit and push it. You
need to push it, because makereleaseJars.sh takes it from the web site.</p>

<p>Edit the pvDataWWW/scripts/makereleaseJars.sh file, updating the the TAG variable
in particular. cd to some directory where you're going
to build the tar, then run /makereleaseJars.sh from where you edited it:</p>
<pre>
% mkdir tmp
% cd tmp
% ../ev4hg/pvDataWWW/scripts/makereleaseJars.sh
</pre>
</dd>

<dt>Documentation:</dt>
<dd><a href="http://epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgweb/epics-pvdata/pvDataWWW/file/tip/scripts/syncjavadoc.sh">syncjavadoc.sh</a>
&ndash; clones the tagged repositoties, generates the JavaDoc, and synchronizes
to the web area. Check it builds the set of modules you want and then execute it
in a scratch area. You may want to comment out the rsync and do that by
hand.</dd>
