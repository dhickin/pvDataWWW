STATUS AND ACTIVITIES
Last update 27-Feb-2013. 

HOT ACTIVITIES
==============
* Efficient handling of big data, esp in IOC. 

    + Looking at redesign of the pvData CPP API for arrays (MD, MK, MS). 
      27/2/13: Work for use of shared_ptr will be separated from work to support
      discontinguous arrays. DH will review API using shared_ptr for symmetry with
      Java, then will implement (with MK's blessing!) [27-2-13]
    + Modifications to IOC for data pipelining (MD, AJ)
      27/2/13: No concrete design yet. Plan to develop from pvaSrv and test image
      server experiences.
    + Creatign a prototype of “batched field access” (BFA) API for high performance
      control of record locksets [27-2-13]. Plan to use in pvaSrv. MD, RL.  

* pvaSrv (the pvaccess server for an "EPICS V3 IOC") hence the primary V3-V4 interop mechanism. 
  RL now working on connection to V3.14. Connection to V3.15 will be later.
  (RES and AIs in http://epicsv4.titanpad.com/ep/pad/view/41/latest)
  
* Performance measurement benchmarking testbench creation; benchmarking EPICS V4
  beta 2.
  MS
  Status: Presented at PSI meeting, but output wasn't right (RMS where meant mean)
  and only indicated mean times, not further structure like how long 1st roundtrip took. 
 
* Assembling formal list of architectures and compilers tried and tested with EPICS V4 
  MS, AJ, GW. 
  [27-2-13] 20/2/13 First pass table for SL and vxWorks completed. 

* vxWorks port, Jenkins, and establishing which versions (<6, or 6.x, or >= 6.6 [for gcc
  4.1.2] only) we will support. 
  DZ,MS,AJ. 
  27/2/13: vxWorks port succeeds if microbenchmarking is not included. MS
  working with DZ to fix.
 
* Installation and deployment of EPICS V4 at PSI, and use in production PSI modelling
  GW/TK/DZ. 
  27/2/13: E 4.2.0-Beta and 4.2.0-snapshot installed at PSI. services and 
  the dev & production environment of those in active development. Health excellent.

* 2013 Charter 
  GW/BD. 
  27/2/13: New thrust for 2013 being evolved to the IOC. pvIOCCPP work being 
  furlowed. Instead work on getting structured data in high perf pipeline from
  exiting IOC being developmed. New Charter draft expected March 2013.

* pvManager and eget integration with Ntypes
  MS
  20-Feb-13 eget can now disp NTImages! 
  DH to get for MS what he needs to encode a BGR image (fourcc code and the image
  depth & color mode)

* Review of requirements for the API of monitors.
  MK. Doc started to review present API [27-2-13] but primary audience (RL) wants
  more detail. RL reviewing and we will take it up again in meeting soon. Required
  for pvaSrv.

Other - are these active or yet to start?
=========================================
* Image Processing pipeline.

Forthcoming activities
======================
In the hopper, or looking for lead.
* Microsoft Visual C++ compiler on Windows port. Lead not known. Est start not known.

* Adding a "reflection" API to pvAccess; that is, an API for
giving data about PVs, so that one can ask for instance, what host is hosting the
pvaccess server which answers for the PV, what is the structure of the PV, etc.

 
INCOMPLETE ACTIVITIES (not including AIs)
==========================================
The following are ongoing activities and those required by the 2011-2012 charter,
which are incomplete.
 
CORE
----
1. Directory Service - not finished - no user guide documentation (RL)

2. easyPVA - not finished, & cpp & java not equally implemented (MS)
   Estimate: java 1 wk, cpp 3 wks. MK thinks more.

3. gather - finished? I don't think it's used anywhere. What is the state of the
   gather example? No bpm service. (MK)

4. v3channel - finished? Not verified, not properly documented. I think this can't be
   said to be finished until it is documented as part of a serious v3-v4 interop
   doc. (MK)

5. v3-v4 interop user guide. Not started. We have just a kinda description from Marty
   about the difference between processing in the two of them. Nothing concrete you
   can give an engineer that says "this is a guide to the interoperation of EPICS V3
   and V4" (DH)

6. vxWorks port - not finished. Beta 2 not started. How should this fit into plan to
   remove database from pvIOC? My feeling is the objective should be a very clean and
   small extract of the present pvIOC should be ported to vxWorks. Possibly only
   formally port v3channel, and formally descope pvIOC from EPICS V4?! (DZ)

7. Performance measurements - not finished. Transferred to new project for micro benchmarking  (MS)

8. ArchiveService. Code complete - but no user guide (DH)

9. exampleJava. Not finished. Needs regularization of serviceAPI and release (GW)

10. Create and release announce beta 2. Depends on 9. (GW)

11. Normative Types. Not finished. Waiting for comments from Michael prior to 1PWD (MD, GW)

12. Javadoc and Doxygen incomplete. Needs much better completeness. Needs to conform
    to much stricter code documentation standards w.r.t. careful use of tense and
    specificity (MK, MS, GW, DH to do Doxygen for CPP modules?)

13. Code comments in pv core modules (MK, MS)

14. Remove ALL warnings from all compiles of pv core code, java and c++. We have 100s
    (MK, MS)

15. Documentation. 
    
    a. pvData and pvIOC documents need significant editing to improve readability. Eg,
    define and provide references for "top level structure", "introspection
    interface", "channel", "record" etc. Must much better distinguish references to
    V3 items and disambiguate such terms, e.g. use of the term "channel access"
    sometimes to refer to the generic control protocol, and sometimes to refer to
    "Jeff Hill's" Channel Access. Make use of uppercase, quotes, italics
    consistently. (MK).

    b. Need a table on the homepage showing the completion status of each thing we're
    doing. (GW)

16. eget/pvget. 

    a. Add demo of acquisition of unsigned (byte for simplicity) from V3
    channel. (MS)
    b. Add full support of NTURI. (MS) 
       i.    Basic regular broadcast acquisition, eg eget pva:///quad45:bdes
       ii.   Registry based name acquisition, eg eget pva://psihost.psi.ch/quad45:bdes
       iii.  Service support; ie, use of query part of NTURI. Eg
             eget pva:///testNTMatrix?columns=3&rows=5 to do equivalent of 
             eget -a columns=3 -a rows=5 -s testNTMatrix
    c. Add mechanism at pvAccess API client side for a client user to choose the
       so-called "provider" of the data, presently planned to be either pvaccess, or
       ca. (MS) 

17. ChannelRPC should be made "asynchronous", or "multithreaded" (what CORBA call
    threaded).That is, more than one client may access at a time.
 

PROPOSED NEW ACTIVITIES
-----------------------
1. Rewrite the C++ implementation of PVValueArray as a C++ STL container,
rather than as now emulating the Java implementation, at least for large arrays.

DATA, APPLICATIONS AND CLIENTS
------------------------------

1. Model service. Not finished. Needs connection to SwissFEL injector, track extant
   machine, GUI. GW
 
2. Unit Conversion - GS, NM, Paul Chu 

3. Orbit Server – TK

4. Test Image service. Intended to help provide test data for development and tuning
   the V4 IOC (2012-13 charter). Started Nov/2012. DH


PERIPHERY ACTIVITIES 
====================
The following are known activities we're tracking but are not in the scope of EPICS
V4.

1. caQtDM. caQtDM is a "synoptic display manager" being used for generating the
   controls UI "screens" for PSI SLS and SwissFEL. Anton Mezger, [1]

2. pyQt apps   - Lingyun Yang, GS

3 PVManager connection to PVAccess. Matej Sekoranja is implementing the vtype "type
  adapter" that will enable one to connect EPICS V4 Normative Types to pvManager
  displays.

4. OLog connection – Kunal Shroff 

5. "ArchiveAppliance" expand for V4 types. Work demoed by Murali. 


OUT OF SCOPE BUT WE'D LOVE IF SOMEONE DID
=========================================
1. Write a pva scheme plugin for a web browser, so one could do pva scheme
   acquisitions directly from a web browser. egs pva:///quad45:bdes,
   pva:///testNTMatrix?columns=3&rows=5.

2. HDF5 serialization of pvData Structures, so one could write EPICS V4 data directly
   to an HDF5 filesystem without intermediate layers.
