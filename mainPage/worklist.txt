2011-2012 Charter
INCOMPLETE ACTIVITIES (not including AIs)
==========================================
The following are ongoing activities and those required by the 2011-2012 charter,
which are incomplete.
 
CORE
----
1. Directory Service - not finished - no user guide documentation (RL)

2. easyPVA - not finished, & cpp & java not equally implemented (MK)

3. gather - finished? I don't think it's used anywhere. What is the state of the
   gather example? No bpm service. (MK)

4. v3channel - finished? Not verified, not properly documented. I think this can't be
   said to be finished until it is documented as part of a serious v3-v4 interop
   doc. (MK)

5. v3-v4 interop user guide. Not started. We have just a kinda description from Marty
   about the difference between processing in the two of them. Nothing concrete you
   can give an engineer that says "this is a guide to the interoperation of EPICS V3
   and V4" (DH)

6. vxWorks port - not finished. Beta 2 not started. How should this fit into plan to
   remove database from pvIOC? My feeling is the objective should be a very clean and
   small extract of the present pvIOC should be ported to vxWorks. Possibly only
   formally port v3channel, and formally descope pvIOC from EPICS V4?! (DZ)

7. Performance measurements - not finished. Transferred to new project for micro benchmarking  (MS)

8. ArchiveService. Code complete - but no user guide (DH)

9. exampleJava. Not finished. Needs regularization of serviceAPI and release (GW)

10. Create and release announce beta 2. Depends on 9. (GW)

11. Normative Types. Not finished. Waiting for comments from Michael prior to 1PWD (MD, GW)

12. Javadoc and Doxygen incomplete. Needs much better completeness. Needs to conform
    to much stricter code documentation standards w.r.t. careful use of tense and
    specificity (MK, MS, GW, DH to do Doxygen for CPP modules?)

13. Code comments in pv core modules (MK, MS)

14. Remove ALL warnings from all compiles of pv core code, java and c++. We have 100s
(MK, MS)

15. Documentation. 
    
    a. pvData and pvIOC documents need significant editing to improve readability. Eg,
    define and provide references for "top level structure", "introspection
    interface", "channel", "record" etc. Must much better distinguish references to
    V3 items and disambiguate such terms, e.g. use of the term "channel access"
    sometimes to refer to the generic control protocol, and sometimes to refer to
    "Jeff Hill's" Channel Access. Make use of uppercase, quotes, italics
    consistently. (MK).

    b. Need a table on the homepage showing the completion status of each thing we're doing. 


DATA, APPLICATIONS AND CLIENTS
------------------------------

1. Model service. Not finished. Needs connection to SwissFEL injector, track extant
   machine, GUI.
 
2. Unit Conversion - Guobao, Nikolay, Paul Chu 

3. Orbit Server – Timo


PERIPHERY ACTIVITIES 
====================
The following are known activities we're tracking but are not in the scope of EPICS
V4.

1. ctqtDM

2. pyQt apps   - Lingyun Yang, Guobao

3 PVManager connection to PVAccess – Matej Sekoranja      

4. OLog connection – Kunal Shroff 

5. "ArchiveAppliance" expand for V4 types. Work demoed by Murali.
