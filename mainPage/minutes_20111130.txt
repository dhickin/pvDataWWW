========= Meeting 30th Nov 2011 ============
 Greg White: Present: TK, GS, JR, MK, MS, NM, RL, GW
 : How about moving to an etherpad for scribing?
 James Rowland: James Rowland set new picture

**********************
 : NEW TOPIC  Definition of NTImage
**********************
 : NM: Results of study about client performance.
 : NM Most other formats are proprietary. Suggestion: start with a popular one
 : RgbaImage
 guobao shen: I can not hear any
 Greg White: Sound is fine for me
 : NM agree with JR that NDarray is needed
 : NM: asks for opinions on his proposal.
 : NM: This applies to RGB color and greyscale mode.
 : GW: how does NDarray fir in?
 : NM: Always image description and raw data.

 : NM: r NDarray in the context off AreaDetector consists of image and metadata.
 : JR AD's NDarray != NTarray !!

 Greg White: To RL, yea, know what you mean
 : GW: The normative type NDarray is specific to AD, should be renamed to reflect that.
 : GW: NM is proposing another normative type RgbaImage. Usage of the two is unclear.
 : JR: NDarray was a generic multi-dim array type. That will be useful.
 : JR: On top of that, we need an image tyoe.
 : JR: Take the AD type with all massaging needed to get it into PVdata and call it NTimage.
 : JR: NM proposes a subset called RgbaImage. My suggestion Avoid the extra type.
 : - confusion -
 : JR: rather have a single type and have clients or servers decide which encodings and features they support
 : GW Well that sounds simple!
 : JR: NTimage should be a superset of AD's capabilities.
 : JR: So that we are at least capable of transporting AD stuff.
***********
 : Resolution: Create NDarray as a generic multi-d array, maybe change the name to avoid confusion with AD stuff.
***********
 : Create an NTimage type that is a superset of what AD is able to provide.
 : What about MDarray?
 : NM leaves.
 : JR Matrix?
 : JR: The AD C++ class for V3 is called NDarray.
 : GW: We need the name for the generic multi-dim array
 : RL: MDarray?
 : GW: NTMatrix?
***********
 : Resolution: the new generic multi-dim array type is called NTMatrix.
***********
 : For rectangular array of numerical data.
 : Wikipedia: a matrix (plural matrices, or less commonly matrixes) is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions.
 : JR: should be a multi-dimensional array
 : GW: is worried about efficiency for N>2
************
 : AI on GW,JR ->Dec12   Define multi-dim array normative type..
************
 : JR the image type will be a superset of NTmatrix.
***********
 : Resolution: NTImage will be derived from the existing structure intended for AD data.
***********
************
 : AI on JR,NM  ->Dec12   Define image normative type.
************
 : JR Encoding the metadata will be the hard part.
 : GW Does extending the NT for name-value pair to arrays help?
 : - I hate triple negations -
 : MK: JR should put down a strawman with some concrete example implementations.
 : JR: Will do.
**********************
 : NEW TOPIC Motivations motivated by MASAR
**********************
 : RL What does MASAR stand for???
 James Rowland: http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/doc/pvIOCCPP.html
 guobao shen: MAchine Snapshot Archiving and Retrieve
 : OH, thanks.
 : MK: explains the example ServiceChannelRPC server.
 : GW: When a client is making a request to the server, the request looks like a table, is a table, but can't contain a table.
 : JR: This is not enforced!
 : MK: Every NT is a top level PV structure

 : JR,GW: the new example code looks great and simple to use.
 : GW: We need a bug tracker.
 : GW: Use a sourceforge one.
 : GW: Lets use another of the standard generic SF trackers.
 : RL: Whatever you say.
 : MK: Other suggestions, Ralph?
 : RL: No.
 : There will be a new tracker, called BUGS, open for logged in SF users.
 Timo Korhonen: I can see the tracker
 : GW will add a test bug to test the email notification stuff.
 guobao shen: bye
 Timo Korhonen: bye
