<h3>caLink, dbLink, and caV3 client</h3>

<p>The syntax accepted by these three components are not consistent with each
other or with caV4. They will be changed to be consistant as follows: </p>
<ul>
  <li>caLink will no longer look for a field named propertyNames.</li>
  <li>All will allow the following alternatives for defining the set of
    fields to access: 
    <ol>
      <li>A pvame of the form recordName.request where request is a string as
        defined by ChannelAccess.createRequest.</li>
      <li>A request structure as defined in package
      org.epics.pvData.pvCopy</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This will not be backwards compatible with this release and may require
changes in caV4 clients that use caV3 and in databases that use caLink. </p>
<h3>portDriver</h3>
<p>Support for talking to hardware has just begun and nothing is ready
for real applications. Also portDiver will probably be moved to a different
project because it will evolve on a path that differs from the javaIOC.</p>
