<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>This section defines the terminology used in this document.</p>
<h3>EPICS Version 3</h3>
<dl>
   <dt>EPICS Base</dt>
      <dd>The main core of EPICS, comprising the build system and tools, common and OS-interface libraries,
       Channel Access client and server libraries, static and run-time database access routines,
        the database processing code, and standard record, device and driver support.
      EPICS base existed since 1991 and gone through many releases.
     This document discusses the 3.14 releases.
   </dd>
   <dt>CAV3</dt>
      <dd>This is the Channel Access component of EPICS Base.</dd>
   <dt>iocCore</dt>
      <dd>The following components of EPICS Base: static and run-time database access routines,
        the database processing code, and standard record, device and driver support.</dd>
   <dt>V3IOC</dt>
      <dd>What EPICS Version 3 calls an IOC.
      EPICS uses Client/Server and Publish/Subscribe techniques to communicate between the various computers.
      Most servers (called Input/Output Controllers or IOCs) perform real-world I/O and local control tasks,
      and publish this information to clients using the Channel Access (CA) network protocol.</dd>
   <dt>V3Record</dt>
      <dd>A memory resident record as defined by EPICS Base.</dd>
</dl>
<h3>EPICS Version 4</h3>
<dl>
  <dt>pvData</dt>
    <dd>The definition of data.</dd>
  <dt>pvAccess</dt>
    <dd>Network support for pvData.</dd>
  <dt>pvIoc</dt>
     <dd>Like V3IOC except the database is composed of pvRecords.</dd>
  <dt>pvRecord</dt>
      <dd>A memory resident record which has data defined as pvData,</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Both iocCore and pvIOC are based on the concept of a database
of memory resident "smart" records.
A record is called smart because code is attached to the record
and is triggered by asking the record to process.</p>
<p>CAV3 (channel access version 3), which is a component of iocCore,
provides network access to iocCore records.
pvAccess provides network access to pvIOC records.
Both access a record via the channelName which is just 
the name of the record and optionally the name of a field in the record.
The record name must be unique within the local area network.</p>
<p>This document provides an overview of:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>Channel Access<dt>
     <dd>Overview of the code that provides network access to data.</dd>
   <dt>Record and Record Processing</dt>
     <dd>Overview of how data in a record is structured and an overview of what happens
     when a record is processed.</dd>
</dt>
<p>Each of these is discused first for iocCore and then for pvAccess/pvIOC.</p>
<p>Before starting the discussion it is important to state that the C++ version of pvIOC is not
complete.</p>
<h2>pvIOCCPP is not complete</h2>
<p>There are both Java and C++ implementations of pvData, pvAccess, and pvIOC.
The Java and C++ implementations of both pvData and pvAccess are complete.
Java provides a complete implementation of pvIOC.
The C++ implementation is only beginning. The last section briefly describes the current implementation.<p>
<h2>Channel Access</h2>
<h3>CAV3</h3>
<p>For CAV3 a channelName consists of a "recordName.fieldName"
The default fieldName is "VAL".
The field data has one of the following types:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>scalar</dt>
    <dd>This is one of:
       <dl>
          <dt>integer</dt>
            <dd>Signed 8, 16, and 32 bit integers.</dd>
          <dt>IEEE floating point</dt>
             <dd>Single and Double precision</dd>
          <dt>string</dt>
             <dd>A 40 character C style string</dd>
       </dl>
     </dd>
  <dt>array</dt>
     <dd>An array of one of the scalar types.
       An array has fixed capacity but the length can vary.</dd>
  <dt>enumerated</dt>
     <dd>An index + a set of up to 16 26 character C style strings.</dd>
</dl>
<p>In addition a field can have some set of the following properties.</p>
<dl>
    <dt>alarm</dt>
       <dd>status and severity where each is a 16 bit signed integer.
        There is a header file and code for manipulating alarms.</dd>
    <dt>timeStamp</dt>
      <dd>An unsigned 32 bit integer that is the number of seconds since 1990
       and an unsigned 32 bit integer that is nano seconds within the second.
        There is a header file and code for manipulating timeStamps.</dd>
    <dt>display</dt>
      <dd>display limits,precision, alarm limits, and units.</dd>
    <dt>control</dt>
       <dd>control limits</dd>
</dl>
<p>CAV3 provides I/O  functions that falls into the following classes:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>get</dt>
      <dd>The client specifies the data type desired plus a set of property data.
        A fixed set of structures are defined for the property data.
        The IOC converts between the data type of the IOC record field and what
        the client requests.</dd>
   <dt>put</dt>
      <dd>The client specifies the data type desired.</dd>
   <dt>monitor</dt>
      <dd>The client specifies the data type desired plus a set of property data.</dd>
</dl>
<p>CAV3 provides no way for the client to influence record processing.
Puts can cause processing but database access decides if a put causes a
record to process.</p>
<h3>pvAccess</h3>
<p>For pvAccess a channelName consists of just the recordName.
How the client specifies what data and options are desired are discussed below.
For now just realize that each data item passed between client and server
is a via an identical top level pvStructure on each side.</p>
<p>A brief description of a pvStructure is that it is a structure that has
a set of PVFields where each field has one of the following types:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>scalar</dt>
    <dd>This is one of:
       <dl>
          <dt>boolean</dt>
            <dd><b>true</b> or <b>false</b></dd>
          <dt>integer</dt>
            <dd>Signed and unsigned 8, 16, 32 and 64 bit integers.</dd>
          <dt>IEEE floating point</dt>
             <dd>Single and Double precision</dd>
          <dt>string</dt>
             <dd>In Java a Java String. In C++ a std::string.</dd>
       </dl>
     </dd>
  <dt>array</dt>
     <dd>An array of one of the scalar types. Both the capacity and length
       can vary</dd>
  <dt>structure</dt>
     <dd>A substructure.</dd>
  <dt>structureArray</dt>
     <dd>An array of PVStructures where each element has the same introspection
      interface.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Although pvAccess itself does not get involved,
pvData defines a set of "standard" PVStructures and assocated code
called properties.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b> pvData and pvAccess are not directly involved with normative types (NT).
They merely make it possible to create NT structures.</p>
<p>The currently defined property structures are:</p>
<dl>
    <dt>enumerated</dt>
      <dd>A structure that has two fields: an integer index,
      and an array of strings named choices.</dd>
    <dt>alarm</dt>
       <dd>A structure that has fields status and severity
         where each is a 16 bit signed integer. In addition there is a string field
         named message.
        There are interface definitions and code for manipulating alarms.</dd>
    <dt>timeStamp</dt>
      <dd>An signed 64 bit integer that is the number of seconds since 1970
       and a signed 32 bit integer that is nano seconds within the second.
        There are interface definitions and code for manipulating alarms.</dd>
    <dt>display</dt>
      <dd>display limits, description, format, and units.</dd>
    <dt>valueAlarm</dt>
      <dd>If the value field is type numeric then a structure with fields
         alarm limits, active, hystersis.
       If the value field is an enumerated structure then
      a structure with fields active, changeStateSeverity, and stateSeverity.
      The stateSeverity is an integer array. </dd>
    <dt>control</dt>
       <dd>control limits</dd>
</dl>
<p>pvAccess provides the following:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>channelProcess</dt>
     <dd>Ask for a record to process without any data transfer between client
      and server.</dd>
   <dt>channelGet</dt>
     <dd>Transfer data from server to client.
     The data is transfered between identical top
     level structures, which are created when the channelGet is created.
     Only data that has changed since the last get is tranfered.</dd>
   <dt>channelPut</dt>
     <dd>Transfer data from server to client.
     The data is transfered between identical top
     level structures, which are created when the channelPut is created.
     Only data that has changed since the last put is tranfered.</dd>
   <dt>channelPutGet</dt>
     <dd>This is a put followed by a get. Different structures are involved with
     put and get but again the structures at each end are created when the
     channelPutGet is created.
     Only data that has changed since the last putGet is tranfered.</dd>
   <dt>channelArray</dt>
      <dd>This supported put and get of  subarray.
         The offset and lengthi are specified.</dd>
   <dt>channelRPC</dt>
      <dd>This is a put followed by get. No structures are created when the
      channelRPC is created. The structures for each request can be completely
      different than the previous request.</dd>
   <dt>monitor</dt>
      <dd>Ask to receive data from the server everytime the data changes
      subject to some algorithm. Each side can create a queue of structures for the
      data. Only data which changes is transfered. The client is notified of
      queue overflows.</dd>
</dl>
<p>When a client connects to a record the client receives an interface Channel.
The interface has a create method for each of the above,
i.e. createChannelProcess, etc.
Each of these create methods has an argument "PVStructure pvRequest".
The pvRequest structure is passed from the client to the server.
pvAccess itself does not care what is in pvRequest; it is just a top level pvStructure.
But a set of conventions exist for communication with a PVIOC.
A pvAccess server should follow the same conventions unless it has special
requirements.</p>
<p>There is a "convenience" service that, given a string, creates a pvRequest.
A simple example is:</p>
<pre>
pvRequest = createRequest("field(alarm,timeStamp,value)");
</pre>
<p>The details are provided in pvAccessJava.html.
The brief description is that the pvRequest allows the client to specify the following:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Data Desired</dt>
    <dd>The client can select an arbitary subset of the fields in the pvIOC record.
     This applies to channelGet, channelPut, and channelMonitor.
     For channelPutGet the client can separately specify the put and get structures.
    </dd>
  <dt>Record Options</dt>
    <dd>An example is:
<pre>
pvRequest = createRequest("record[process=true]field(alarm,timeStamp,value)");
</pre>
      This asks that the record be processed.
      There are two standard record options:
      <dl>
        <dt>process</dt>
         <dd>This can have the value <b>true</b> or <b>false</b>.
          This option applies to channelGet, channelPut, and channelPutGet.
          The default is <b>false</b> for get and <b>true</b> for channelPut
          and channelPutGet. For channelRPC there is no process option since proccess is implied.
         </dd>
        <dt>queueSize</dt>
          <dd>This is for monitor.</dd>
      </dl>
    </dd>
   <dt>Field Options</dt>
     <dd>Options can also be specified for individual fields.
       A standard option for scalar array fields is <b>shareData</b>.
       Monitor accepts options for monitor algorithms.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Record and Record Processing</h2>
<h3>V3IOC record data</h3>
<p>A record is a flat structure, i.e.
it is a structure that has a set of fields each of which has a name.
Each field is one of the following types:</p>
<pre>
DBF_STRING,
DBF_CHAR,
DBF_UCHAR,
DBF_SHORT,
DBF_USHORT,
DBF_LONG,
DBF_ULONG,
DBF_FLOAT,
DBF_DOUBLE,
DBF_ENUM,
DBF_MENU,
DBF_DEVICE,
DBF_INLINK,
DBF_OUTLINK,
DBF_FWDLINK,
DBF_NOACCESS
</pre>
<p><b>DBF_CHAR</b>, ... ,<b>DBF_DOUBLE</b> are the numeric types.
The other types are:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>DBF_STRING</dt>
     <dd>This is a string field. A string field has a capacity
        determined when by how the field is created.
       The actual data is a C char array.
       It can have any size which can be determined via facilities
       provided by dbAccess.</dd>
   <dt>DBF_ENUM</dt>
      <dd>This is a for the <b>VAL</b> field.
        The field is an unsigned 16 bit integer.
       The Record Support Entry Table (rset discussed below) provides
       a method <b>get_enum_strs</b> which provides the set of choices.
       The bi, bo, mbbi, mbbo, etc record types inplement the choices
       via a separate DBF_STRING field for each choice.
      A client can only change a choice by knowing details about the
      record type.
      </dd>
   <dt>DBF_MENU</dt>
      <dd>The V3 database supports this type. It makes the data available to
      clients as a enumerated value. The choices are immutable.</dd>
   <dt>DBF_DEVICE</dt>
      <dd>This is the type for field DTYP,
       which is a field common to all record types.
       It specifies what type of device support is attached
       to the record. It is also made available to clients as
       an enumerated value. The choices are determined when the record
       instance is created and can not be changed dynamically.</dd>
   <dt>DBF_INLINK</dt>
   <dt>DBF_OUTLINK</dt>
      <dd>These are string fields used by device support.
       The format is determined by the device support.
      Some types of device support can be changed dynamically
      but the client must know the syntax</dd>
   <dt>DBF_FWDLINK</dt>
      <dd>This is a string field that can hold the name of another record.
     If configured then when the record holding the link is processed
     the linked record is also processed.</dd>
   <dt>DBF_NOACCESS</dt>
      <dd>This is a field that hold private data that can not be accesed
       from outside the record.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>V3IOC record processing</h3>
<p>A record instance has a record type.
Each record type has a fixed set of fields. Each has a common set of 43 fields
and a set of record type specific fields. For example ai adds 39 fields
and mbbi adds 65 fields. Most of these fields are not of interest to clients.
The field of most interest is VAL. Many other fields are <b>properties</b>
of the value field. Normally client code does not directly access property fields
but gets their values via chnnelAccess.
Many fields are private and can not be accessed via channelAccess.</p>
<p>EPICS base provides a set of record types, e. g. ai, ao, bi, bo, etc.
It also provides facilities for defining additional record types.
Each record type has associated code that is accessed via a rset (Record
Support Entry Table):</p>
<pre>
typedef struct rset {   /* record support entry table */
        long            number;         /*number of support routines    */
        RECSUPFUN       report;         /*print report                  */
        RECSUPFUN       init;           /*init support                  */
        RECSUPFUN       init_record;    /*init record                   */
        RECSUPFUN       process;        /*process record                */
        RECSUPFUN       special;        /*special processing            */
        RECSUPFUN       get_value;      /*get value field               */
        RECSUPFUN       cvt_dbaddr;     /*cvt  dbAddr                   */
        RECSUPFUN       get_array_info;
        RECSUPFUN       put_array_info;
        RECSUPFUN       get_units;
        RECSUPFUN       get_precision;
        RECSUPFUN       get_enum_str;   /*get string from enum item*/
        RECSUPFUN       get_enum_strs;  /*get all enum strings          */
        RECSUPFUN       put_enum_str;   /*put string from enum item*/
        RECSUPFUN       get_graphic_double;
        RECSUPFUN       get_control_double;
        RECSUPFUN       get_alarm_double;
}rset;
</pre>
<p>
These method are called by dbAccess, which is major component of iocCore.
Method <b>process</b> is called to process the record.
The details are determined by the record suport.
The methods <b>get_value</b>, ... ,<b>get_alarm_double</b> are all related
to the field named <b>VAL</b>.
<b>get_array_info</b> and <b>put_array_info</b> apply if the value field
is an array. <b>get_enum_str</b> ,..., <b>put_enum_str</b> apply if value
is an enumerated field.
The other <b>get_xxx</b> methods get properties of the value field.</p>
<p>Three fields from dbCommon releted to record processing are
<b>SCAN</b>,<b>FLNK</b>, and <b>DTYP</b>.
Many record types have either a field <b>INPUT</b> or <b>OUTPUT</b>.
<dl>
   <dt>SCAN</dt>
     <dd>This is a menu field that determines what causes the record to process.
      A record can be processed periodically or by two different interrupt
     mechanism. A record can also be declared passive, which means
     that it is only processed when a client or a link from another record
     asks that the record be processed. A field can have an attribute
     of process passive. When a client issues a put to the field and SCAN
     is passive then the record is processed.</dd>
   <dt>FLNK</dt>
      <dd>This is a forward link. The link can either be a dblink or a calink.
         For a dblink the linked record will be part of the same scan set
        as the record containing the FLNK. The concept of scan set is 
        discussed below. This field is handled by dbAccess rather than the
        record support.</p>
   <dt>DTYP</dt>
      <dd>A record type can have associated device support.
       Device support is called by record support via a dset (device support
      entry table. The device support can be anything that implements
      the dset. Often the device support accesses hardware. A common example
      is support that communicates with the asynDriver facility.
      But iocCore provides support for links the other records (dblink)
      and to CAV3 channels (calink). Like FLINK the dblink record will be
      in the same lock set.</dd>
   <dt>INPUT</dt>
   <dt>OUTPUT</dt>
     <dd>If the record type has an INPUT field then, by definition,
     it is an input record, i. e. it gets data from somewhere else.
     Similarly if it has an OUTPUT field it is an output record.
     In either case this field is a string field that has configuration
     information for the device support. The format is determined by
     the device support.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Because processing a record can cause linked records to also be processed,
the concept of scan set exists.
Before a record is processed a function <b>dbScanLock</b> is called and when
it completes processing <b>dbScanUnlock</b> is called.
All records linked together directly or indirectly are placed in the same lock set.
When dbScanLock is called the entire set, not just the specified record, is locked.
This prevents two different tasks from simultaneously modifying records in the same lock set.
</p>
<p>Device support can be either synchronous or asynchronous.
A synchronous record is a record where device support can complete without
wait for I/O. Asynchronous support is support that needs to wait.
Asynchonous processing consists of two two phases: process start
and process completion.
Between the two phases the record is unlocked.</p>

<h3>pvIOC record data</h3>
<p><b>NOTE:</b> currently record and record processing is only
implemented by pvIOCJava.</p>
<p>A PVRecord has a top level PVStructure.
Thus the data layout is just PVData.
As mentioned above pvData defines standard structures and support for
enumerated, alarm, timeStamp, display, control, and valueAlarm.
</p>

<h3>pvIOC record processing</h3>
<p>pvIOC has the the same processing features as V3IOC.
The main difference are:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>locking</dt>
     <dd>The record is locked. There is the ability to
     lock one other record but no concept of scan sets.
     The concept of synchronous and asynchronous does exists.</dd>
   <dt>support</dt>
     <dd>No concept of record types, record support, and device support exists.
     Instead support can optionally be attached to any field.
     Support must implement the methods defined by interface <b>Support</b>
     When support is initialized it looks, starting with the field to
     which it is attached, for fields that it requires.
     Several basic support modules are provided by pvIOC.
     Amoung these is <b>Generic</b>. It is normally attached to the
     top level structure. It looks in the immediate substructure for
     each field that have attached support and calls it's support methods</dd>
   <dt>support configuration</dt>
     <dd>Configuration is done via PVData fields</dd>
</dl>
<p>The interface for support is:</p>
<pre>
interface Support {
    void initialize();
    void start(AfterStart afterStart);
    void stop();
    void uninitialize();
    void process(SupportProcessRequester supportProcessRequester);
}
</pre>
<p>Although record types do not exist there are standards for field layout
so that the equivalent of the V3IOC ai, ao, etc records can be created.</p>
<p>Support is provided that implements database and channelAccess links.</p>

<h2>CAV3/V3Record &lt;==&gt; pvAccess/pvIOC</h2>
<p>The status of interoperability between V3 and pvIOC/pvAccess is:</p>
<dl>
   <dt>pvAccessJava</dt>
      <dd>A pvAccess can comunicate with a channel via either CAV3 of pvAccess.
       In either case the data appears to the client as pvData.</dd>
   <dt>pvIOCJava</dt>
     <dd>This provides a CAV3 server. This allows a CAV3 client to access fields of a PVRecord.</dd>
   <dt>pvAccessCPP</dt>
     <dd>Currenly has no support for CAV3.</dd>
   <dt>pcIOCCPP</dt>
     <dd>v3Channel is a pvAccess server for accessing V3 records.</dd>
</dl>
<p>From the point of view of a pvAccess client.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Java Client</dt>
    <dd>Has access to a channel using either the CAV3 or pvAccess network protocal.
      Thus it has access to PVRecords on a pvIOCJava and to V3 records on any V3 IOC.
    It also has access to multiChannal data that resides in a pvIOCCPP.
    </dd>
  <dt>C++ client</dt>
    <dd>Has access to a channel only via pvAccess protocal.
      Thus it has access to PVRecords on a pvIOCJava and 
     has access to V3 data only if the V3IOC has the v3Channel server running.
    It also has access to multiChannal data that resides in a pvIOCCPP.</dd>
</dl>
<p>A CAV3 client has access to a channel that is a PVRecord only if the record
is on a pvIOCJava.</p>

<h2>Status of pvIOCCPP</h2>
<p>pvIOCCPP is the C++ implementation of pvIOC.
<p>As of the beta 2 release of EPICS V4 the only complete feature provided
by pvIOCCPP so <b>v3Channel</b> , which provides pvAccess for V3 records.</p>
<p>This allows a pvAccess client access to a V3Record with out using CAV3.</p>
