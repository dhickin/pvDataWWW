<h1 style="text-align: center">Status of Implement Unsigned and Move FieldName<br />
Marty Kraimer,Matej Sekoranja<br />
12-Apr-2012</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The following is the status of implementing unsigned integers and moving fieldName from Field to Structure.
The original proposal is in unsigned.html.
Status is given first and then changes to the original proposal from 10-Feb-2012.</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>pvDataJava, pvAccessJava, and pvIOCJava have been converted.
No work has been started on the C++ code.
The plans are to start this before the work on the Java implementation is finished.</p>
</p>
<p>The following work remains of the Java implementation</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Documentation</dt>
    <dd>The documentation has not been updated.</dd>
  <dt>V3 ClientFactory</dt>
  <dd>ClientFactory does not work. It will be moved from pvIOC to pvAccess. See below.</dd>
  <dt>Test Convert</dt>
    <dd>The widening methods for scalars has been tested but not for arrays.
      The scalar tests just print results but should become true regression tests.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Implementation of Unsigned</h2>

<p>The 10-Feb-2012 document described the Java changes as follows:
Because Java does not implement unsigned integers a "best" effort is
implemented.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The data implementation for scalar and array implementation of unsigned
    will be the same as the signed implementation except for a new convenience
    method. For example the implementation of <b>PVInt</b> will be identical to
    <b>PVUint</b> except for a new convenience method <b>getWider</b>.</li>
  <li>The Convert facility will perform the proper conversions between signed
    and unsigned.</li>
  <li>No attempt will be made to detect integer overflow and throw
  exceptions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The widening methods are <b>not</b> implemented as part of the classes PVUByte, ... ,PVULong.</p>
<p>The Convert facility handles widening operation for unsigned integers.
It does not do anything for converting unsigned long (64 bit unsigned).
For example if an unsigned long is converted to a double no check is made for integer overflow.
This is because it requires BigInteger.</p>

<h2>V3 ClientFactory</h2>
<p>This is a facility that uses caV3 to access V3 channel. It converts the V3 data into pvData.
Thus a V4 client receives V3 data as V4 data.</p>
<p>This is currently implemented in pvIOVJava.
It will be  moved to pvAccess. Thus, by defailt, pvAccess will provide two channel providers: pvAccess and caV3.
For java the code in pvIOCJava can be moved to pvAccess with minor changes.
For C++ it will need to be implemented.</p>

<h2>C++ changes</h2>

<p>The 10-Feb-2012 document stated:
As part of the changes for unsigned support the C++ implementation will use
<b>size_t</b> instead of <b>int</b> for everything related to size or length.
This means that C++ on 64 bit architectures will support arrays of size greater
than 2 gigaElements.</p>
<p>This will be done and one additional change will be made to the C++ implementation.
The change involves the classes for accessing array data. In particular class PVArrayData.
It is currently defined as:</p>
<pre>
class PVArrayData {
public:
    POINTER_DEFINITIONS(PVArrayData);
    typedef T  value_type;
    typedef T* pointer;
    typedef const T* const_pointer;
    /**
     * The data array.
     */
    pointer data;
    ...
</pre>
<p>This will be changed to:</p>
<pre>
class PVArrayData {
public:
    POINTER_DEFINITIONS(PVArrayData);
    typedef T  value_type;
    typedef T* pointer;
    typedef const T* const_pointer;
    /**
     * The data array.
     */
    std::vector&lt;T&gt; &amp; data;
    ...
</pre>
<p>In addition the array definitions for BooleanArray,...,StringArray in pvTypes.h will be changed.
For example:</p>
<pre>
typedef double * DoubleArray;
becomes
typedef std::vector&lt;double&gt;&amp; DoubleArray
</pre>
<p>The reason for this change is to help prevent core dumps by code that misuses arrays.
For example assume code does the following:</p>
<pre>
struct myStruct{
double *doubleArray;
};


...

DoubleArray data;
pvDoubleArray-&gt;get(0,len,&amp;data);
pmyStruct.doubleArray = data.data;
</pre>
<p>That is the code saves the address of the double array.
If some other code changes the capacity of the PVDoubleArray then the double array is deleted
and the code above has a pointer to the deleted memory.
Using vector prevents this problem.</p>
