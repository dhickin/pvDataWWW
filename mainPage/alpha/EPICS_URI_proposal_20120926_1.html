        Abstract
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following outlines an EPICS V4 URI syntax. The syntax
        includes support for requests for Channel values subject to
        arguments (as implemented by ChannelRPC). The URI syntax is
        then used to define a new Normative Type, NTURI, that
        encodes the same information as the EPICS V4 URI. In this
        way, the service API is defined as a case of the EPICS V4
        API, and both by reference to the IETF standard for
        accessing resources. Example EPICS V4 URIs are given, and
        example Java source for constructing an NTURI.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        As we've known for a year, we need a standard for the API
        of EPICS V4 services.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that, Matej and Anton can write general purpose
        clients, since they'll know how to express a, possibly
        parameterized, request for data from a PV. I'd like to have
        a clear association of the resource identification standard
        URI (IETF RFC 2396) [1] to how EPICS V4 identifies
        acquirable data in an EPICS network.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is, when we ask an EPICS V4 agent for data, it should
        be that what you ask (the PV name and associated
        parameters) should map to URI semantics (see note 1).
      </p>
      <p>
        A URI for EPICS V4 should encompasses all channels types,
        not just RPC channels. Also, by "EPICS V4" I mean to
        include EPICS V3. The URI standard [1], allows latitude to
        define a URI's semantics according to the scheme (the part
        before the "://".
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, below I propose a pvaccess schema URI mapping.
        Then, given the mapping, describe a new normative type
        "NTURI" that encodes such a URI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, I include a CA schema for illustration, but
        just for the basics of getting a PV value by name. Gurus
        invited to make that better.
      </p>
      <h2>
        URI suitability for expressing EPICS Channel requests
      </h2>
      <p>
        Looking at the IETF standard (TBL's from 1998!) section 3
        gives the syntactic components. The mapping to EPICS V4 RPC
        agent requests seems uncomplicated. But it does mean we
        have to agree on where in the syntax to put EPICS V4
        channel request parts. Also the scope of the "authority"
        and "path" parts probably need a normative decision with
        respect to EPICS V3. Note that there is some latitude in
        [1], <cite>"The URI syntax does not require that the
        scheme-specific-part have any general structure or set of
        semantics which is common among all URI."</cite>
      </p>
      <p>
        Generic URI Syntax for representing hierarchical relations
        [1, part 3]:
      </p>
      <pre class="definition">
 &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;authority&gt;[&lt;path&gt;][?&lt;query&gt;]
      </pre>
      <p>
        In conformance with [1], the path part and query part of an
        EPICS URI are optional. Proposed Part Assignment for EPICS
        URI
      </p>
      <h2>
        URI Part EPICS V4 Semantics
      </h2>
      <p>
        Proposed URI part semantics for EPICS:
      </p>
      <pre>
 scheme    = {pva|ca}  
 authority = Channel name.  So the authority MUST be given. 
             The channel may or may not be an RPC channel  
 path      = Entity required from RPC channel. If path is given then 
             the authority part MUST give a ChannelRPC channel name 
 query     = Arguments to an RPC channel, such as the starttime of 
             an archive data request.
</pre>
      <p>
        When pvdata request [2] syntax is clarified, the query may
        also be used to encode the pvData request string.
      </p>
      <h3>
        URI Path parameters
      </h3>
      <p>
        In [1] a URI "path" part itself includes an optional
        facility for encoding "params" [1, section 3.3]. Params in
        a URI path do <em>not</em> necessarily have assigned value
        (although you can use the "=" character in a path param, so
        a pvaccess URI processor could be written to interpret URI
        path params as having assigned value, I suggest we don't
        use that latitude). URI path params are more like
        properties of the preceding path, e.g. the archived history
        of a quad's B field. Or modelling properties like R-matrix,
        or Twiss.
      </p>
      <p>Path parameters follow the main part of the path, separated from it by a ";".
      </p>
      <pre>
 path param = facet of interest of the PV (optional). E.g. "quad34:bdes;history"
</pre>
      <p>
        In example 7 below, "history" is given as a path parm.
        Other params that may be understood by an archive service
        might be "smoothed", in which the median filter or moving
        average is returned, or simply "average".
      </p>
      <h3>
        URI reference fragments
      </h3>
      <p>
        URI fragments are the things after a "#". For instance we
        use them on our web site to give links to parts of
        documents, eg 
        http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/pvAccess_Protocol_Specification.html#flowControl.
      </p>
      <p>
        The URI spec [1, section 4.1] say URI fragments are
        intended for isolating "partial views" of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, they're a good fit for specifying the EPICS V4 pvdata
        request options [2].
      </p>
      <pre>fragment = pv field request</pre>
      <p>
        For example
        <code>powersupply#field(alarm,timeStamp,power.value)</code>
        There is a possible issue with this use of fragments, see
        Scope and Limitations #2 below.
      </p>
      <h3>
        URI with respect to channel put
      </h3>
      <p>
        All examples below are of a "get", none of put or monitor.
        That's ok, URIs identify a resource, they're agnostic to
        whether the identification is for put, get or monitor of
        data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, we want sometimes to put values, and sometimes
        they're complex or long values (e.g. uploading new gradient
        setpoints for all magnets in an accelerator section). How
        that going to be done?
      </p>
      <p>
        When you upload complex data to a web service through HTTP
        PUT, the URI doesn't encode the data. It rather refers to
        the data, typically encoded in XML in an XMLHttpRequest
        object, which is uploaded on a different port.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than "send out of band" like XmlHttpRequest, NTURI
        could be defined to include the facility to encode any
        data, but optionally so. Arbitrary pvData Fields may be
        added to an NTURI instance at runtime. The interpretation
        of these is entirely up to the service endpoint.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the string form of an NTURI, like
        <code>pva://rdbservice/swissfel/in/quads</code>, should not
        attempt to "serialize" those optional fields. Similarly,
        pvput is not to be expected to accept such arbitrary fields
        on the command line. Note, the difference between pvput and
        pvget is fungible for ChannelRPC, since the URI is
        identifying a resource, and may be carrying update data.
      </p>

      <ol>
      <li>
        pvaccess of V3 channel by V3channel, not giving field
        <pre class="uri">
	pva://quad34:bdes
	</pre>
      </li>
      <li>
        pvaccess of V3 channel by V3channel, giving field

      <li>
        ca of V3 channel

      <li>
        ca of V3 channel, giving field

      <li>
        pvaccess of V4 channel
      <pre class="uri">
        pva://quad34:bdes
      </pre>
      <li>
        pvaccess of ChannelRPC channel, giving no arguments
      <p>
        Example below is asking a relational db service to get the
        (table) resulting from the SQL query named
        "swissfel/in/quads" (Swissfel injector quadrupoles). The
        relational Db service would know how to translate
        "swissfel/in/quads" into the appropriate SQL. RdbService
        presently can do that.
      </p>
      <pre class="uri">
        pva://rdbservice/swissfel/in/quads
      </pre>
      <p>
        where: <br />
        "rdbservice" = ChannelRPC channel name = URI authority.  <br />
        "/swissfel/in/quads" = URI path
      </p>
      <li>
       pvaccess of ChannelRPC channel, giving arguments
      </p>
      <p>
        Example below is asking for the archived history of a
        quad's B field setpoint, from a start time to an end time.
      </p>
      <pre class="uri">
        pva://archiveservice/quad34:bdes;history?starttime=2011-09-16T02.12.55&amp;endtime=2011-09-16T10.01.03
      </pre>
      <p>
        We can't use ":" in URI queries because ":" is a reserved
        character [1, section 3.4], so "." is used in this example.
      </p>
      </li>
      </ol>
      <h2>
        NTURI
      </h2>
      <p>
        The new Normative type, called NTURI
        (uri:ev4:nt/2012/pwd:NTURI), can encode the above URI
        syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, through the optional field-types and
        field-values, it can encode 'any' data. So NTURI can encode
        both a reference to a resource, and data for the resource.
        This is proposed to be the way complex data is sent to a
        service.

            should be interpreted to mean the "bdes of all the

        <li>
          Limitation of using URI fragments to encode field
          requests 
          <p>
            Formally, a URI "fragment" is an identifier of a part
            of the resource *that is isolated by the agent after it
            has retrieved the resource*. I propose we contravene
            the spec in that regard. However, there is a possible
            downside. Imagine a EPICS V4 web service that can get
            EPICS data over pvaccess in the usual way. A HTTP
            client like your browser talks to the EPICS web
            service. You'd want the URI semantics used by the HTTP
            communication, from your browser to the web service, to
            be exactly the same as the URI pvaccess scheme
            semantics. And they could be, except for fragments.
            Because fragments are intended to be processed client
            side, the specification of the EPICS record field
            request probably would never go over the wire. The
            EPICS V4 web service would probably never see the field
            request. Still, I think that's ok. The suitability of
            URI fragments for "partial data" specifications
            outweighs the incompatibility for web services.

          The URI syntax is less important, though if the semantics
          match, clearly there must also be some syntactic match.

          so" - I'm sure Ben will correct me.)
        </li>
        <li>
          The generic URI syntax includes facilities for encoding
          explicit hierarchy, but does not preclude a flat value
          space. We should design a for *potentially* hierarchical
          value space. That is, we should use and assign EPICS
          semantics to facilities of the URI syntax for hierarchy,
          not ignore them.

          *Marty*, I tried to integrate "request" into the URI, but
          I came up against a number of things: i. Wasn't clear to
          me if requests only pertain to monitors. The
          documentation I found in pvData is was only under Monitor
          Request Options [2]. ii. I think I see mistakes in the
          documentation, and I can't work around them because the
          formalizm is not complete. The documentation doesn't
          distinguish literals from non-literals or terminals from
          non-terminals. And the examples appear to contradict the
          syntax given in terms of plurality and optionality. 
          <p>
            If we can fix these issues, or I see I was mistaken, I
            can integrate it in the URI. However, one thing I
            notice straight alway, is you use "," in the syntax,
            which is a reserved character in the URI query syntax,
            though not in URI fragment syntax.
