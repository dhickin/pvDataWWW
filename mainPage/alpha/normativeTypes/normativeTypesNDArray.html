<p>

The NTNDArray is a EPICS Version 4 normative type, that is, a software design for a composite data type specified in the <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes.html">normative types specification</a>. It is designed to encode data from detectors and cameras, especially
<a href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetector.html">areaDetector</a> applications. The type is heavily modelled on areaDetector's <a href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/epics/areaDetectorDoxygenHTML/class_n_d_array.html">NDArray</a>.

</p><p>
One NTNDArray gives one frame of data.

</p><p>
This document contains a candidate definition for NTNDArray, discusses
the design choices and is intended to get answers to a number of
outstanding questions. The intended audience is both the V4 and
areaDetector communities.

</p><p>
Note: NTNDArray replaces the previous <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes_20121018.html#ntimage">NTImageType</a> normative type defined by James Rowland and Ulrik Pedersen.

</p><p>
In this document NDArray by itself will always refer to the areaDetector
 type with NTNDArray refering to the EPICS version 4 normative type.

</p><h2 id="design_goals">Design Goals</h2>

<p>
The NTNDArray is designed to
</p><ol>
  <li>Encode all data in an areaDetector NDArray, so that it may be
transported losslessly via pvAccess and so existing areaDetector that
plugins may run remotely
  </li><li>Allow straightforward and unambiguous encoding/decoding of NDArrays as NTNDArrays</li>
  <li>Minimise the resending of unmodified data</li>
  <li>Allow efficient implementation of the area detector processing chain</li>
</ol>
<!--
<p>
Essentially NDArrays have the following information:
</p><pre>a) Array data,
b) 1..* Dimension Structures (containing size, offset, binning and reverse fields)
c) uniqueID
d) 0..* Attribute Structures (each containing a name, value of heterogenous type, description, source and source type)
e) Timestamps (time, epicsTime)
</pre>

<p>
In addition the NTNDArray might contain data which is compressed either
because the image itself has been compressed using an image codec or has
 been compressed for transport via pvAccess. So to the above information
 we might add:

</p><p>
</p><pre>f) Compression algorithm
</pre>

<p>
We might also add fields to enable easy monitoring of the data size, both of the compressed and uncompressed data
</p><pre>g) Data sizes
</pre>


<p>
There are also some standard optional fields for V4 PVs:

<h2 id="notes">NTNDArray: Detailed description</h2>

<p>
This section contains a description for each part of the NTNDArray as
well as a discussion of the reasons for the design and any outstanding
questions relating to it.
</p><p>
</p>

<h3 id="array_data">Array Data</h3>

<p>
The "value" field stores the
actual image data which corresponds to the data pointed to by the pData
field in NDArray. In the original NTImage this field was any one of the
array types, i.e. its type was hardcoded in the introspection data. This
 had the drawback that it did not allow the type of data to change
dynamically. The demos have used byte arrays containing pData's bytes
and a int dataType field containing a value corresponding to NDArray's
dataType. This has potential issues with endianness.
<p>
Now that we have support for unions we can use these for the data. So
the value field will be one of the array types and this type can change
dynamically. Note this is a union of arrays not an array of unions, so
it is implemented with the data ultimately in a single scalar array.
</p><p>
Unsigned integer support has also been added since the original, earlier definition.
</p><p>
</p>

<h4 id="Notes">Uncompressed data</h4>

<p>
When the id of the structure in the "codec" field (described more fully below)
is the empty string
the data in "value" is uncompressed and contains only array data.
</p><p>
In the case the "value" field will contain the values corresponding to
the N-dimensional array as a single array, according to the dimension
("size") field (described below), of the appropriate type in the usual,
obvious way.
</p><p>
The size of the array MUST NOT be less than the product of the
dimensions when the data is uncompressed (otherwise it won't make
sense). I think also the array length in the uncompressed case SHOULD
equal the product of the dimensions.
</p><p>
Note that in areaDetector the NDArray "dataSize" field may be more than
the product of the all the dimensions and the size of element type (so
that For the NT type length * element_size may be less than
NDArray::dataSize).
</p><p>

</p><h4 id="Endianness">Endianness</h4>

<p>
As the data is stored in an array of the appropriate type the endianness of the data will be that of the host.
</p><p>
In the majority of cases the endianness of the data in the buffer
pointed to by pData in an NDArray will match that of the host.
</p><p>
In the cases where it doesn't it is desirable to get the data matching
the host endianness as soon as possible. That way plugins can be written
 to be agnostic of endianness. This should be done in the areaDetector
driver or failing that in a plugin in the chain prior to the V4 plugin.
Therefore the NTNDArray does not need to consider endianness.
</p>

<p>
So assuming the endianness of the data in the buffer pointed to by pData
 matches that of the host the it will be possible to create a
shared_vector of appropriate type around the existing void* buffer and
swap into the PVXArray, helping to achieve zero-copy.
</p>

<h4 id="non-array">Non-N-d-array data formats</h4>

If the image data is not an n-d array this should be corrected by processing
done in the driver or early in the plugin chain. So NTNDArray need
 not consider this case.

</p>



<h4 id="Compression">Compression</h4>

<p>
NTNDArray allows for the possibility that the data is compressed, in
which case the enterpretation is determined by the "codec" field
(described below), in conjuction with the "size" field. I would typically
 expect the array in the union "value" field to be a byte array in this
case, but I haven't required this. The enterpretation is given by the
"codec" field and this may include the array containing the compressed
data being of a type other than byte[].
</p><p>
With compression the length*element_size("value") MAY be (and typically
will be) less than the product of the dimensions and the size of the
element type of the uncompressed data.
</p><p>
</p>

<h3 id="Data Size">Data Size</h3>

<p>
It is not possible to monitor the length of an array using pvAccess without monitoring the whole array.
To make it easier to monitor the size of image data two fields have been added.
</p>
<p><pre>structure NTNDArray
    // ...    
    long compressedSize
    long uncompressedSize
    // ...
</pre>
</p>
With compression the length*element_size("value") MAY be (and typically
will be) less than the product of the dimensions and the size of the
element type of the uncompressed data.
</p><p>
</p>

<h3 id="compression_algorithm">Compression algorithm</h3>

<p>

In NTNDArray, by default the value field contains a 1-d array which is interpretted as an N-d array
according to the dimension field. The codec field allows for this behaviour to be extended
</p>
<p><pre>structure NTNDArray
    // ...    
    structure codec_t codec
        string name
        any    parameters
    // ...
</pre>
</p>

In an NDArray pData will typically point to a buffer containing an N-d
array of data. So a 2-d monochrome image will be stored as a 2-d array
and a 2-d RGB image as a NxMx3 3-d array.

<p>
However the NTNDArray allows for other possibilities.

</p><p>
e.g.
</p><ol>
<li>the data has been compressed for more efficient network transport (e.g. with lz4, blosc etc).</li>
<li>the data is in a compressed image format (e.g. JPEG)</li>
<li>the data is otherwise in a non standard format.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first may be particular important as in an areaDetector processing
chain involving network transport and with sufficent processing power
the bottleneck is likely to be the network bandwidth. even with 10Gig
ethernet. The areaDetector/V4 plugin demo has already shown that we can
go beyond the bandwidth using compression.

<p>The second may be useful. E.g. hardware or driver performs compression.</p>

<p>There is no obvious use case for the 3rd, but the option is available to handle a special case.

</p>

 <p>
The "codec" field is included to cater for other possibilities.
</p><p>
If the "codec" field is the empty string then value contains
uncompressed area detector as an N-d array of the type determined by the
 type of the array in the union "value" and of dimensions given by the
"size" field.
</p>
This allows us solve the problem of arguments as well as namespace qualification, as this has addressed already for IDs.
</p>


<h3 id="dimensions">Dimensions</h3>

<p>The "dimension" field is a structure array corresponding to the NDDimension_t[] in NDArray.
</p>
</p><pre>structure NTNDArray
    // ...
    structure[] dimension
        structure dimension_t
           int size
           int offset
           int fullSize
           int binning
           int reverse
    // ...
</pre>
<p>
<p>

The fields of the structure
 "size", "offset", "binning", "reverse"
corresponding to the size, offset, binning and reverse fields of
NDDimension_t  "size" field of NDArray. These encode the following
information
<dl>
  <dt>size</dt>
    <dd>The number of elements in each dimension of the array</dd>
  <dt>offset</dt>
    <dd>The offsets relative to the origin of the original data
source (detector, for example). If a selected region of the detector is
being read, then this value may be &gt; 0. The offset value is
cumulative, so if a plugin such as NDPluginROI further selects a
subregion, the offset is relative to the first element in the detector,
and not to the first element of the region passed to NDPluginROI.</dd>
  <dt>binning</dt>
    <dd>The binning (pixel summation, 1=no binning) in this dimension relative to original data source
      source</dd>
  <dt>reverse</dt>
    <dd>The orientation (0=normal, 1=reversed) in this dimension relative to the original data source
      source</dd>
</dl>

<p>

</p><p>
There is also a field: <dt>fullSize</dt>  <dd> The size for each dimension of the whole image of which the NTNDArray is a part.</dd>

</p><p>
For a simple image fullSize=size. For a ROI fullSize = dim(original image).
In other case the detector image may be made up of multiple images, each
 with their own (NT)NDArray.

</p><p>
A use case is the Excaliber detector which
has a 6x8 array of 256x256 pixel photon detectors arranged into 6 strips
 of 8 cells each producing a 2048x256 image. In this case the sizes
would be 2048x256, the fullSize would be 2048x1536 the offsets would be
0x0, 0x256, 0x512 etc. It is possible to have detectors with gaps where
there are no pixels. This can be handled with appropriate sizes, offsets
 and values. In the current set up a plugin converting an NDArray to an
NTNDArray would need to know the geometry and be configured to input the
 correct fullSize.


</p><p>
The number of dimensions of the NTNDArray may be 0. A well-designed client should check
the number of dims. This allows a default NTNDArray PV to be created
(e.g. prior to receiving it's first NDArray).




<h3 id="uniqueid">uniqueId</h3>

<p>
This corresponds to the NDArray uniqueId.
<pre>structure NTNDArray
    // ...
    int       uniqueId
    // ...
</pre>
</p>


<h3 id="dataTimeStamp">dataTimeStamp</h3>

<p>
This is the time stamp in seconds for the array. This corresponds to the NDArray timeStamp. The latter is a double but in NTNDArray it is a time_t.
<pre>structure NTNDArray
    // ...
    time_t     dataTimeStamp
    // ...
</pre>
</p><p>
Note there is a second time stamp in NTNDArray (timeStamp). This corresponds to epicsTimeStamp in areaDetector and in this case can come from a user-defined timestamp source.
</p>

</p>
<h3 id="attributes">attribute</h3>

<p>The attribute field encodes the linked list of NDAttributes in areaDetector.
</p>

<p>
<pre>structure NTNDArray
    // ...
    structure[] attribute
        structure NTAttribute
            string  name
            any     value
            string  description
            int     sourceType
            string  source
    // ...
</pre>
</p>


This uses the NTAttributes type
<p>
<pre>structure NTNDArray
    // ...
    structure[] attribute
        structure NTAttribute
            string    name
            any       value
            string[]  tags        :opt
            string    description :opt
            time_t    timeStamp   :opt
            alarm_t   alarm       :opt
            display_t display     :opt
    // ...
</pre>
</p>
<p>
However for NTNDArray the description field is mandatory and there are mandatory additional fields sourceType and source.
</p>

The attribute values are of a heterogenous type.
Previously we had to use NTVariant[] to encode them. Now we can use a union or any.

<p></p>


</p><p>
</p><h3 id="optional_fields">Optional fields</h3>
<p>
    NTNDArray has the usual set of optional fields.
</p><p>
</p>
<pre>structure NTNDArray
    // ...
    string     descriptor  :opt
    time_t     timeStamp   :opt
    alarm_t    alarm       :opt
    display_t  display     :opt
    // ...
</pre>
</p></p>
Note this second time stamp will typically correspond to epicsTimeStamp in areaDetector
and in this case can come from a user-defined timestamp source.
