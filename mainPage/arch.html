<p>EPICS V4 is a software platform for high performance control
systems and data services. This document summarises the components of EPICS V4, and
outlines some software architectures that may be employed using it. It includes
such things as interoperation with EPICS V3, services for aggregating the data of
many Input Output Controllers, connection to online data sources such as databases,
and facilities for building Service Oriented Architectures.

<h2 id="Introducti">Introduction</h2>
EPICSv4 extends the scope of EPICSv3 with structured data types and
request/response messaging patterns. 

<p>EPICSv3 systems consist of I/O controllers (IOCs) connected to
temperatures, magnet currents, beam positions, and other scalars and vectors
of timestamped primitive types. Above this layer are objects such as response
matrices, machine lattice descriptions and backup and restore groups that are
not easily modelled in the limited range of data types available in EPICSv3.
Facilities use tools such as Matlab and SDDS to model high level concepts.
Similarly many high-level services are request/response, returning the result
of some processing or retrieval in response to a query. Tools such as Corba
or Web Services fill this role, as EPICSv3 only has 'put with callback', a
response that indicates that processing has completed but carries no
payload.</p>

<p>EPICSv4 supports Java, C++ and Python clients and servers on Windows,
Linux and OSX. vxWorks portability is being tested.

<h2 id="Overview">Overview of EPICSv4</h2>

<h3 id="Type">Type System and Serialization (pvData)</h3>
pvData is a run-time type system with serialization and introspection. A
similar product is <a
href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/">Google Protocol
Buffers</a> (PB), an important difference is that pvData always has the full
type information (including field names) present when messages are encoded or
decoded, while PB depends on precompiled stubs on each side.

pvAccess Java Reference Documentation</a></p>

<p>The EPICSv4 network protocol is <strong>pvAccess</strong>. pvAccess is a
TCP protocol, a connection to a named endpoint is a <strong>Channel</strong>.
Channel endpoints have unique names within a facility, and the default name
resolution method is UDP broadcast prior to connection. Channels are typed
with the type determined by the server. </p>

<p>pvAccess supports the following messaging patterns: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Introspection 
    <ul>
      <li>GetField (client asks for the type of a channel endpoint)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Request/Response 
    <ul>
      <li>Put</li>
      <li>Get</li>
      <li>PutGet (atomic)</li>
      <li>Process</li>
      <li>Remote Procedure Call (like PutGet but request type is determined
        by the client)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Publish/Subscribe 
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="L208">I/O Controller (pvIOC)</h3>
The IOC combines pvData structures with processing behaviour to form
<strong>records</strong>. A domain-specific configuration language allows
these records to be connected in a dataflow style to form a
<strong>database</strong>, allowing customization of behaviour without
systems programming.

<h3 id="Normative">Normative Types</h3>
To allow generic clients and prevent the unbounded spread of
application-specific types, the EPICSv4 Working Group specifies a set of
(about 10) <a href="alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes.html">Normative
Types (Document)</a> for common use cases. Examples are timestamped control data,
relational database tables and multi-dimensional images. Generic tools will
operate on Normative Types and it is expected that facilities will use
Normative Types for the majority of applications. 

<h2 id="Standard">Standard Components and Nominal Architectures</h2>
This section demonstrates the use of EPICSv4 with components that are found
in many facilities. It is typical for each facility, and often each service
within a facility, to use their own network protocol and data model. 

<h3 id="Hello">Hello World</h3>

<p>The most basic architecture is single client, single server, using RPC.
The RPC server does not contain an EPICSv4 database, the developer implements
the processing in C++, Java or Python code.</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleJava/tree/default/src/helloWorld">helloWorld</a>
example is located in the exampleJava project, currently it is not possible to write an RPC server in Java without the IOC database but this will be added.
</p>

<p><img src="archfiles/arch_hello.png" alt="hello world diagram" /> </p>

<h3 id="Process">Process Control / SCADA</h3>
EPICSv4 supports all EPICSv3 messaging patterns including publish/subscribe
via Monitors. 

<p><img src="archfiles/arch_ioc.png" alt="ioc diagram" /> </p>

<h3 id="pvaSrv">EPICSv3 Integration (pvaSrv)</h3>
Currently EPICSv4 focusses on high-level applications. It is expected that
facilities will continue to use EPICSv3 IOCs for I/O until drivers are
available for EPICSv4 IOCs. pvaSrv is a pvAccess server that runs on an
EPICSv3 IOC, allowing EPICSv4 clients to communicate with EPICSv3 process
variables. 

<p>The pvaSrv example is bundled with pvaSrv.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/epics-base/pvaSrv/tree/default/iocBoot/testV3Channel/st.cmd">Startup Script for pvaSrv Example</a></p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/epics-base/pvaSrv/tree/default/testApp/testV3Channel/src/Makefile">pvaSrv Example Makefile</a></p>

<p>
The last working version of the pvaSrv example is on the default branch of pvaSrv.
It compiles against the 2.0-BETA releases of pvDataCPP, pvAccessCPP, and pvIOCCPP.
These are the combination of changesets you need:
</p>

<pre>
hg clone http://epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvIOCCPP -r 2.0-BETA
hg clone http://epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvDataCPP -r 2.0-BETA
hg clone http://epics-pvdata.hg.sourceforge.net/hgroot/epics-pvdata/pvAccessCPP -r 2.0-BETA
</pre>


<p>The <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/pvaSrv/tip/documentation/html/index.html">pvaSrv
documentation</a> explains the 3 simple steps needed to install the pvAccess server in your V3 IOC.</p>

<p><img src="archfiles/arch_v3.png" alt="v3 integration diagram" /> </p>

<h3 id="Client">Client Stream Query (pvManager)</h3>
<a href="http://pvmanager.sourceforge.net">pvManager</a> is a client utility
library for EPICSv3 and EPICSv4 that performs rate reduction and averaging on
data streams. This abstration layer makes writing robuts clients easier,
especially GUIs. <img src="archfiles/arch_pvmanager.png"
alt="pvmanager diagram" /> 

<h3 id="Client">Operator Interfaces (OPI)</h3>
The proposed client tool for OPI is <a
href="http://cs-studio.sourceforge.net">Control System Studio</a> (CSS) BOY.
The BOY widgets will be updated to use pvManager as their data source. <img
src="archfiles/arch_boy.png" alt="opi diagram" /> 

<p>A limited functionality proof of concept using the org.csstudio.data API directly to make a CSS EPICSv4 connector is <a href="https://github.com/epics-base/pvAccessCSSTests/tree/default/org.csstudio.utility.pv.pvAccess/src/org/csstudio/utility/pv/pvAccess/PVpvAccess.java">here</a>.
</p>

<h3 id="Service">Service Aggregation (Gather)</h3>
Many facilites need to concatenate and summarize information from many
sensors into a single location, for example the electron beam position in a
synchrotron is presented to the user as a vector but is read from many
devices throughout the facility (see Diamond BPM Concentrator). The Gather
service is a standard implementation of this pattern. 

<p>The Gather service combines values from multiple sources into a single
point. The Gather service can also support EPICSv3 Channel Access. This is so
that Gather can be used without upgrading existing EPICSv3 servers with
v3Channel. Gather can be used as a software component or a service. </p>

<p>Gather used as a software component: <img src="archfiles/arch_gather.png"
alt="gather diagram" /> Gather used as a service component (details omitted):
<img src="archfiles/arch_gatherservice.png" alt="gather service diagram" />
</p>

<h4>Gather Implementation</h4>
<p>Gather is ready for testing. The server is implemented in Java.
The client is implemented in Java, C++, and Python.
It is expected that the way gather currently presents data to the client will change
but until it has been used by real applications it is not clear what to do.</p>

<p>The MASR service contains its own gather implementation, see the code <a href="https://github.com/epics-base/masarService/tree/default/cpp/src/client/gatherV3Data">here</a> 
that will soon be merged with the other gather libraries.</p>

<h3 id="Model">Model Service</h3>
The Model Service returns information from the machine model, such as the
linear optics matrices of a particle accelerator. It may return
pre-calculated values or connect to a simulation code. <img
src="archfiles/arch_model.png" alt="model service diagram" /> 

<h3 id="Relational">Relational Database Service</h3>

<p>Most facilites need to retrieve information from relational database
tables. The RDB Service provides a database-independent way to perform canned
queries over EPICSv4. The mapping from a query name to an SQL query string
can be stored in the Directory Service (discussed later) or in the RDB
itself.</p>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleJava/tree/default/src/rdbService">rdbService</a> is 
located in the exampleJava project.
</p>

<img src="archfiles/arch_rdb.png" alt="rdb service diagram" /> 

<h3 id="Name">Name Resolution Server</h3>
EPICSv3 includes a little-used name server that can respond to UDP name
requests with the target IP address and TCP port of the server, replacing the
UDP broadcast name resolution. It would be possible to have a Name Resolution
Server of this type in EPICSv4. 

<h3 id="Scripting">Machine Physics and Scripting</h3>
Matlab Middlelayer is an interactive scripting environment used for machine
commissioning. The EPICSv4 Java client connects Matlab to high-level services
and process data. The Normative Types provide data in a form suitable for
manipulation without further processing, such as timestamps in Matlab date
format, and tables as structures of arrays. <img src="archfiles/arch_mml.png"
alt="mml diagram" /> 

<h3 id="Save">Save and Restore</h3>
Process data setpoints must be saved to permanent storage and restored to
reset the facility to a known working state. MASAR is the EPICSv4 Save and
Restore tool. It combines RPC, Service Aggregation (Gather), and RDB access.
An RPC client initiates the save or restore request, the MASAR server Gathers
the process variables and stores them in the RDB.

<img src="archfiles/arch_masr.png" alt="masr diagram" /> 


<h3 id="Time-Serie">Time-Series Database</h3>
EPICS archivers are a familiy of time-series databases. The EPICS Channel
Archiver (RTree) is a chunked array store with an RTree index and a C++ API,
libStorage. The EPICSv4 archive service provides a pvAccess RPC interface to
these files, supporting range queries with on-the-fly decimation including
statistics (mean/min/max) into a table structure. This replaces the XMLRPC
interface distributed with the EPICS Channel Archiver. <img
src="archfiles/arch_archiver.png" alt="archiver diagram" /> 

<p><a href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleCPP/tree/default/ChannelArchiverService">ChannelArchiverService Project Repository (decimation is not supported yet)</a>
</p>

<h3 id="Data">Data Acquisition</h3>
X-Ray detectors produce image frames annotated with experimental metadata. 10
Gigabit Ethernet is increasingly used to transport these images from the
acquisition machine to a storage server. Protocols for this include network
or distributed file systems such as NFS or Lustre, or custom TCP protocols.
Each custom TCP protocol must deal with connection handing, error handing and
serialization. Data is stored in HDF5 files. pvAcces provides an efficient
TCP transport for structured image types in conjunction with areaDetector.

<p>Contact <a href="mailto:ulrich.pedersen@diamond.ac.uk">Ulrich Pedersen at Diamond</a> for more information about acqusition to HDF5 over 10gbE </p>

<img src="archfiles/arch_detector.png" alt="detector diagram" /> 

<h3 id="Service1">Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) and Directory
Services</h3>
EPICSv4 services are self-describing through introspection of channel
endpoints. EPICSv4 services are also discoverable via broadcast name
resolution of globally unique channel endpoint names. Further discoverability
can be provided by the Directory Service. The EPICSv4 directory service is <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/channelfinder">ChannelFinder</a>. 

<p>ChannelFinder returns lists of Channel names and properties associated
with a particular key. This can be used to answer queries such as "return a
list of channels endpoint names that are connected to this magnet". Other
high-level services such as Save and Restore may depend on the information in
the Directory Service. The Directory Service may store information in a
relational database, but the interface exposes the associations between items
in a typical facility in a standard way. </p>

<p>ChannelFinder is a REST web service, and was designed to be used in
EPICSv3 and EPICSv4 installations. The REST interface provides additional
authentication functionality, but a pvAccess interface to ChannelFinder is
under development to facilitate integration with EPICSv4.</p>

<p>The ability to populate the Directory Service from an <a
href="http://aps.anl.gov/epics/irmis/index.php">IRMIS</a> database is also
under development but using IRMIS is not mandated. <img
src="archfiles/arch_ds.png" alt="directory services diagram" /> </p>
