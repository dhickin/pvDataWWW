<h2 id="Introducti">Introduction</h2>
EPICSv4 extends the scope of EPICSv3 with structured data types and
request/response messaging patterns. 

<p>EPICSv3 systems consist of I/O controllers (IOCs) connected to
temperatures, magnet currents, beam positions, and other scalars and vectors
of timestamped primitive types. Above this layer are objects such as response
matrices, machine lattice descriptions and backup and restore groups that are
not easily modelled in the limited range of data types available in EPICSv3.
Facilities use tools such as Matlab and SDDS to model high level concepts.
Similarly many high-level services are request/response, returning the result
of some processing or retrieval in response to a query. Tools such as Corba
or Web Services fill this role, as EPICSv3 only has 'put with callback', a
response that indicates that processing has completed but carries no
payload.</p>

<p>EPICSv4 supports Java, C++ and Python clients and servers on Windows,
Linux and OSX. <!-- check this! -->
</p>

<h2 id="Overview">Overview of EPICSv4</h2>

<h3 id="Type">Type System and Serialization (pvData)</h3>
pvData is a run-time type system with serialization and introspection. A
similar product is <a
href="http://code.google.com/apis/protocolbuffers/">Google Protocol
Buffers</a>, an important difference is that pvData always has the full type
information (including field names) present when messages are encoded or
decoded. 

<h3 id="Network">Network Procotol (pvAccess)</h3>
See also <a href="pvAccess_Protocol_Specification.html">pvAccess Protocol
Specification (Technical Document)</a> 

<p>The EPICSv4 network protocol is <strong>pvAccess</strong>. pvAccess is a
TCP protocol, a connection to a named endpoint is a <strong>Channel</strong>.
Channel endpoints have unique names within a facility, and the default name
resolution method is UDP broadcast prior to connection. Channels are typed
with the type determined by the server. </p>

<p>pvAccess supports the following messaging patterns: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Introspection 
    <ul>
      <li>GetField (client asks for the type of a channel)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Request/Response 
    <ul>
      <li>Put</li>
      <li>Get</li>
      <li>PutGet (atomic)</li>
      <li>Process</li>
      <li>Remote Procedure Call (like PutGet but request type is determined
        by the client)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Publish/Subscribe 
    <ul>
      <li>Monitor</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="L208">I/O Controller (pvIOC)</h3>
The IOC combines pvData structures with processing behaviour to form
<strong>records</strong>. A domain-specific configuration language allows
these records to be connected in a dataflow style to form a
<strong>database</strong>, allowing customization of behaviour without
systems programming. 

<h3 id="Normative">Normative Types</h3>
To allow generic clients and prevent the unbounded spread of
application-specific types, the EPICSv4 Working Group specifies a set of
(about 10) <a href="alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes.html">Normative
Types</a> for common use cases. Examples are timestamped control data,
relational database tables and multi-dimensional images. Generic tools will
operate on Normative Types and it is expected that facilities will use
Normative Types for the majority of applications. 

<h2 id="Standard">Standard Components and Nominal Architectures</h2>
This section demonstrates the use of EPICSv4 with components that are found
in many facilities. It is typical for each facility, and often each service
within a facility, to use their own network protocol and data model. 

<h3 id="Hello">Hello World</h3>

<p>The most basic architecture is single client, single server, using RPC.
The RPC server does not contain an EPICSv4 database, the developer implements
the processing in C++, Java or Python code.</p>

<p><img src="arch_hello.png" alt="hello world diagram" /> </p>

<h3 id="Process">Process Control / SCADA</h3>
EPICSv4 supports all EPICSv3 messaging patterns including publish/subscribe
via Monitors. 

<p><img src="arch_ioc.png" alt="ioc diagram" /> </p>

<h3 id="EPICSv3">EPICSv3 Integration (v3Channel)</h3>
Currently EPICSv4 focusses on high-level applications. It is expected that
facilities will continue to use EPICSv3 IOCs for I/O until drivers are
available for EPICSv4 IOCs. v3Channel is a pvAccess server that runs on an
EPICSv3 IOC, allowing EPICSv4 clients to communicate with EPICSv3 process
variables. 

<p><img src="arch_v3.png" alt="v3 integration diagram" /> </p>

<h3 id="Client">Client Stream Query (pvManager)</h3>
<a href="http://pvmanager.sourceforge.net">pvManager</a> is a client utility
library for EPICSv3 and EPICSv4 that performs rate reduction and averaging on
data streams. This abstration layer makes writing robuts clients easier,
especially GUIs. <img src="arch_pvmanager.png" alt="pvmanager diagram" />

<h3 id="Service">Service Aggregation (Gather)</h3>
Many facilites need to concatenate and summarize information from many
sensors into a single location, for example the electron beam position in a
synchrotron is presented to the user as a vector but is read from many
devices throughout the facility (see Diamond BPM Concentrator). The Gather
service is a standard implementation of this pattern. 

<p>The Gather service combines values from multiple sources into a single
point. The Gather service can also support EPICSv3 Channel Access. This is so
that Gather can be used without upgrading existing EPICSv3 servers with
v3Channel. Gather can be used as a software component or a service. </p>

<p>Gather used as a software component: <img src="arch_gather.png"
alt="gather diagram" /> Gather used as a service component (details omitted):
<img src="arch_gatherservice.png" alt="gather service diagram" /> </p>

<h3 id="Scripting">Scripting</h3>
Matlab Middlelayer is an interactive scripting environment used for machine
commissioning. The EPICSv4 Java client connects Matlab to high-level services
and process data. The Normative Types provide data in a form suitable for
manipulation without further processing, such as timestamps in Matlab date
format, and tables as structures of arrays. 

<h3 id="Save">Save and Restore</h3>
Process data setpoints must be saved to permanent storage and restored to
reset the facility to a known working state. MASAR is the EPICSv4 Save and
Restore tool. It combines RPC, Service Aggregation (Gather), and RDB access.
An RPC client initiates the save or restore request, the MASAR server Gathers
the process variables and stores them in the RDB. 

<h3 id="Time-Serie">Time-Series Database</h3>
The Channel Archiver returns tables of time-series data. EPICS archivers are
a family of specialized time-series databases. The EPICS Channel Archiver
(RTree) provides an XMLRPC server, this is a web service protocol using XML
to serialize requests and responses over an HTTP connection. The Archiver
returns vectors of EPICSv3 data types as the result of time range queries. 

<h3 id="Data">Data Acquisition</h3>
X-Ray detectors produce image frames annotated with experimental metadata. 10
Gigabit Ethernet is increasingly used to transport these images from the
acquisition machine to a storage server. Protocols for this include network
or distributed file systems such as NFS or Lustre, or custom TCP protocols.
Each custom TCP protocol must deal with connection handing, error handing and
serialization. Data is stored in HDF5 files. 

<h3 id="Service1">Service Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Directory
Services</h3>
Very roughly, SOA = Services + Discovery. The discovery mechanism is
ChannelFinder, the EPICSv4 Directory Service. 

<p>ChannelFinder can return lists of Channel names and properties associated
with a particular key. This can be used to answer queries such as 'return a
list of channels that are connected to a magnet'. Other high-level services
such as Backup and Restore may depend on the information in the Directory
Service. The Directory Service may store information in a relational database
but the goal is to have a simple interface that models the connections
between items in a typical control system in a standard way. </p>

<p>The first vesion of the EPICSv4 Directory Service will be based on <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/channelfinder">ChannelFinder</a>.
ChannelFinder is a REST directory web service with a relational database back
end. An EPICSv4 interface to ChannelFinder is under development. </p>

<p>The ability to populate the Directory Service from an <a
href="http://aps.anl.gov/epics/irmis/index.php">IRMIS</a> database is also
under development but using IRMIS is not mandated. </p>

<h3 id="Relational">Relational Database Service</h3>
Most facilites need to retrieve information from relational database tables.
The RDB Service provides a database-independent way to perform canned queries
over EPICSv4. The mapping from a query name to an SQL query string can be
stored in the Directory Service or in the RDB itself. 

<h3 id="Name">Name Resolution Server</h3>
EPICSv3 includes a little-used name server that can respond to UDP name
requests with the target IP address and TCP port of the server, replacing the
UDP broadcast name resolution. It would be possible to have a Name Resolution
Server of this type in EPICSv4. </div>
