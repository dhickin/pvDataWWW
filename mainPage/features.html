<p style="margin-top:30px">This page describes features of EPICS Version 4, and how
EPICS V4 may be used to solve various architectural problems of modern control systems.<p>
<hr />

<h2 id="features">What EPICS V4 adds to EPICS Base</h2>

<p>This section lists some of the features of EPICS V4, which make it suitable as 
a platform for a unified controls and services environment for large experimental facilities:</p> 

<p>
       Version 4
       adds a data interaction layer, called pvData, and a new protocol, called
       pvAccess,
       to EPICS Base IOC communications.</p>  
       <p>
       In an EPICS installation it is expected that control and module support would
       be done with EPICS Base IOCs, while middle layer and SOA operations would be done with
       the new facilities of EPICS V4. V4 includes support for protocol
       interoperability with Base IOCs. </p>

       <p> EPICS V4 is composed of a number of core standards and APIs, reference
implementations of those standards in C++ and Java, plus associated other components
and tools. The intention is for the standards and APIs to go through a public review
process, leading to published protocols and APIs that may be independently
implemented.</p>

       <p> The work adds support for "structured" data to EPICS records. That is, a
PV's value need no longer be a simple type or a waveform, but potentially an
arbitrarily complex structure. A <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call">"Remote Procedure
Call"</a> like processing pattern has been added, which supports passing arguments
within the context of asynchronous record processing. In this way services may be
defined.  </p>

<p>Using EPICS 4.4, an EPICS V4 client can interact with the Process Variables (PV)
       in an Input Output Controller (IOC) more effectively and faster than was
       previously possible. Additionally, data services for PV data processing,
       intensive computation or mediating enterprise data, can be implemented right
       in the EPICS suite.  </p>

<h2 id="newin4-4">New Features of EPICS V4 added in V4.4</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In the C++ implementation, arrays are handled more efficiently and safely. The C++ pvData array data types now allow read-only array data to be
swapped in and shared using a new reference-counted shared_vector facility,
minimizing computationally expensive copy operations, and enforce
Copy-On-Write (COW) semantics, helping prevent thread conflicts.</li>
 
  <li>Dynamic data typing is provided by two new union data types (and the two
corresponding array types). In a "regular" union the dynamic type must be one
of a fixed set of types, determined by the introspection interface. In a
variant union it can be any pvData type.</li>
 
  <li>Fixed and bounded scalar arrays have been provided in addition to the
unbounded arrays implemented previously.</li>
 
  <li>Windows has been added to list of supported platforms.</li>
 
  <li>pvAccess has a new API and implementation, which reflects changes in the
pvAccess protocol, giving greater flexibility and more informative channel
data through channel method callbacks.ChannelArray
now allows a stride to be specified in puts and gets.</li>
 
  <li>A new codec based implementation of pvAccess decouples the pvAccess
communication layer from the transport layer, allowing alternative transport
layer protocols such as one using zeroMQ. A codec for the former transport
layer of pvAccess is provided.</li>
 
  <li>A security plugin API that allows pluggable implementations of
specific security schemes for pvAccess or Channel Access has been added to
pvAccess together with one such plugin for Channel Access security.</li>

  <li>A new utility, pvlist, can provide both server information and a list of channels available on that server.</li>

  <li>The pvAccess tools pvget, pvput and eget have better support for enums, timestamps and alarms.</li>
 
  <li>4.4 is up-to-date with the latest normative types specification, including
using the new naming scheme for their type IDs. In particular the tools and
examples using normative types follow the current normative type definitions. </li>
 
  <li>In the C++ implementation, Convert, a facility for converting between two
different pvData objects, has been greatly simplified, and a new facility,
pvSubArray, can copy a subarray from one PVArray to another of the same
element type.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following new alpha software is also bundled:</p>

<ul>
  <li> A new framework [pvDatabaseCPP], implemented in C++, provides V4 records
and databases analogous to the records and databases of version 3. These can
be used to provide V4 services over pvAccess.</li>
 
  <li>A new library [normativeTypesCPP] provides C++ support for the following
normative types: NTScalar, NTScalarArray, NTTable, NTNameValue, NTMultiChannel
and NTNDArray.</li>
 
  <li>A new library [pvaPy] provides a Python API for pvAccess and for pvData
types including support for implementing RPC servers and clients.</li>
</ul>


<h2>New Features of EPICS V4 added in V4.3</h2>

<ul>
  <li>You can access Base IOC PV data over pvAccess. This gives the speed and
facilities of pvAccess to accesses of Base IOCs, and provides the basis for
coming work to allow data of a group of IOC channels to be get or set as a
  single call through pvAccess. See pvaSrv.</li>
   
  <li> PV value I/O can now be done over the Channel Access protocol using only
the pvAccess client. pvAccess contains Channel Access, as a "provider". This
is now available in both C++ and Java implementations of pvAccess. This is
useful if you want to do all your client side PV access (both Base IOC and
  services, through a single client side, pvAccess). See pvAccess.</li>

  <li>vxWorks is directly supported. That is, a pvaSrv module may be loaded
  into a vxWorks IOC.</li>

  <li>An easy to use API, "easyPVA", has been added.</li>

  <li>The support for RPC PVs (PV value subject to arguments) has been much
simplified and extended. There is now a client side library for RPC as well
as the server side framework, and the server side is now very easy indeed.
  These extensions have been made in both, C++ and Java.</li>

  <li>C++ Examples. exampleCPP contains examples of coding both simple
  (helloWorld) and more complex services (EPICS Archiver access).</li>
 
  <li>Get lists of PVs in an IOC, or many other kinds of other systemwide
meta-data, all within the pvAccess protocol. This is provided by a new
simple pvAccess server instance called directoryService , that
  interfaces to the EPICS Channel Finder.</li>
</ul>
