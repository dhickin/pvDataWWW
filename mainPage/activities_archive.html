<h1>Activities of the EPICS V4 Working Group</h1>
<p>Archive of Activities of the EPICS Version 4 WG.</p>

<h2>7-Nov-2011 to 20-Dec-2011</h2>
<p>Concentrating on
simplifying EPICS V4 for the user programmer and regularizing APIs. Specifically,
present activities include:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Review of ezpva and "gather" continue </li>
  <li>ezpva rename. Question of whether to rename, and if so to do it. Depends on whether
  ezpva will include async acquisition</li>
  <li>Implementation of ezpva specification (Marty, Matej)</li>
  <li>NT type definitions specifications (Bob)</li>
  <li>NT type id definition (requires lead)</li>
  <li>NT type implementations (requires lead)</li>
  <li>Question of how to encode NTTable; in CORBA Any style, or as variant union</li>
  <li>Unsigned Int handling. Document, republish to observers, and implement</li>
  <li>Comments on pvAccess specification. Integration of remarks from Michael and
  others. Edits for lingo. (Matej, Marty, Greg).</li>
  <li>pvAccess publication to techtalk</li>
  <li>Reorganisation of pvData & pvIOC javadoc into "classical" javadoc plus
  reference doc (Marty)</li>
  <li>Example and tests of use of pvAccess for async 'monitoring'. (Paul Gibbons,
  Marty, Bob). Outcome should be 1) example code in pvData, 2) Text for a getting
  started document</li>
  <li>Twiss model service design (Guobao, Greg)</li>
  <li>Model simulation service (aka "Online Calculator") design (Guobao, Greg)</li>
  <li>EPICS V4 getting started developer's guide document preparation (Greg, Matej)</li>
  <li>Publishing javadoc for EPICS V4 modules through Maven (Matej, Gabriele)</li>
  <li>Logging and setpoint save tool, design and implementation (Guobao, Marty)</li>
  <li>Moving meeting hosting service from Adobe Connect to something else (Greg)</li>
  <li>Development, code, and documentation standards (Matej, Greg)</li>
  <li>use of Doxygen for documentation generation. What standards must be in place so
  you get useful output, bit just pretty pages with nothing in them (needs lead)</li>
  <li>Question: Sending pvStructure to a service. Is it supported? How do you do it? Need demo</li>
  <li>Sending pvStructure that changes call to call through ezpva. Requires code changes (Matej, Marty)</li>
  <li>Question: Build environment for EPICS V4 in a deployed lab setting (ie, Maven or just
  Make?)</li>
  <li>Deploying rdbService at PSI (Greg)</li>
</ol>

<h2>Oct 2011 to 7-Nov-2011</h2>
<ol>
<li>Normative types. Definitions and binding implementations of the so called,
normative types. These are the data types that it is expected all general purpose
clients will understand, and it is encouraged that services and IOC applications
should supply.</li>
<li>First services, writing and deployment. In particular, a general relational
database access service, and lattice modelling services are being actively
developed</li>
<li>Display tools and frameworks. pvManager, and CSS plugins</li>
<li>Directory service support, in particular channelFinder, and associated CSS plugins</li>
<li>The Gather Service Framework. This is a server side distributed data acquisition
framework, which helps a programmer to construct a service that collects data from a
number of sources (EPICS v4 or EPICS V4 records), and makes it available in the
normative types suiatble for displaying data of a number of devices. For instance,
useful for BPM orbit, or linac energy management services. </li>
<li>Fully implementing the
the <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/pvAccess_Protocol_Specification.html">pvAccess
specification</a> working draft.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Nov-2011 to May 2012</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/pvAccess_Protocol_Specification.html" >pvAccess Protocol Specification</a> is being published at Second Public Working
  Draft after successful expert review. It appears to be ready for independent
  implementation</li>
  <li>Work to allow V4-V3 interoperability without modification to V3 IOCs, is in
  final stages</li> 
  <li>A setpoint save and restore tool (server and client) have been completed (BNL)</li>
  <li>A production level relation database service has been deployed (PSI) (based on the
  <a
  href="https://github.com/epics-base/exampleJava/tree/default/src/rdbService"
  >rdbService example</a>)</li>
  <li>An EPICS V4 based EPICS Archiver service and client have been developed. This
  allows easy (command line) access to archive data
  (Diamond).</li>
  <li>
  A <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/exampleinstall.txt" >nominal architecture for production level EPICS V4 institutional installation,</a>
  has been developed and implemented at PSI, and published as a guide for other institutions</li> 
  <li><a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/alpha/unsigned.html" >Direct support for unsigned integer data type</a>, has recently been completed for
  Java bindings, and is being worked on for C++ bindings of EPICS V4</li>
  <li>Improvements are being made to the primary client-server data acquisition API to
  make it more efficient and intuitive (moving Field name from a property of the
  Field to a property of the field's parent, brings it in line with existing
  introspection API norms</li>  
  <li>An easy to use API, <a href="http://epics-pvdata.sourceforge.net/docbuild/alphaJava/tip/easyPVA/documentation/easyPVA.html" >EasyPVA</a>, is at alpha and being reviewed</li>
  <li>"Gather Service," a service platform for helping a programmer to acquire data from many V3 PVs in
  a service, and supply them as a single record to a V4 client, is at alpha and being
  tested</li>
  <li>A BPM orbit service, based on Gather, is being developed (PSI)</li>
  <li>"<a href="alpha/normativeTypes/normativeTypes.html" >Normative Types</a>", a normative document which defines interoperable application level data
  types, is approaching
  First Public Working Draft. Requires expert review first. The way these types
  self-identify is being worked on </li>
  <li>Work is just beginning on a general purpose EPICS V4 Directory Service
  (HZB)</li>
  <li>A general purpose command line tool, "eget" is being developed</li>
  <li>Downloaders are beginning to compile and install EPICS V4 IOC on VxWorks,
  Windows and RTEMS. It now compiles in VxWorks 6.0, while v5 is in work in
  progress. EPICS V4 has recently been compiled in MS Windows, and being tested
  now</li>
  <li>An accelerator model service is about to be started</li>
